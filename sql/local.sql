Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of episodes ago, I mentioned the Community Summit in the small list of big things. That&#8217;s coming up on August 22nd and 23rd, right before WordCamp US. And for some of you, that made complete sense, and the only thought in your mind was, wow, our last one was in 2017, how could so many years have passed since then? And since so many years have passed, today we&#8217;re gonna talk a bit about the Community Summit, what it is, where it came from, and why it&#8217;s so important for the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:09]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>First things first, let&#8217;s talk about what exactly the Community Summit is. The Community Summit is a small event where folks from around the WordPress project and community come together to work through some of the most difficult topics the project currently faces, many of which are easier or at least less fraught when we can be face-to-face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Community Summit is usually done in an “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference\">unconference</a>” style, and when we were smaller, we left topic gathering and voting to the day of. That&#8217;s evolved a bit as our group of fearless contributors has grown over the years, and this year, we have been asking for topics ahead of time so that we can make sure we have the right folks in the room and are making the best use of everyone&#8217;s limited time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to take a look at this event and think it&#8217;s like some fun exclusive thing with a who&#8217;s who of WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I assure you it&#8217;s a working event. Decisions are not finalized during the event, but since we try very hard to account for many, many viewpoints, it ends up being two days of hard discussions, contentious viewpoints, and problem definition at a level of complexity you don&#8217;t really see every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hearing how hard this event is, you may be wondering why we put in that effort. There are a lot of reasons, but there are three that come to my mind immediately. So for starters, working across cultures is hard. Apart from the cultural differences, we tend to be aware of things like where we&#8217;re located or our lived experiences, things like that– working remotely or distributedly is a whole different set of skills than working in person. This helps remind everyone that we&#8217;re humans, that there are humans behind those comments and behind those messages in Slack. The second thing is that I&#8217;m a big supporter of Tuckman&#8217;s theory of group development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know what that is, you can look for it, we&#8217;ll put a link in the show notes, but it&#8217;s that forming, storming, norming, performing kind of concept of how groups come together. Because there are so many of us and our community has such a large footprint, there are little storms a-brewin all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some get really big, some stay small. But at some point, most of them have to be addressed. And this is a space that is specifically designed to help us do that. Which brings us to the third reason that we do it. This event uses something called the Chatham House Rule, which creates a kind of temporal psychological safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. Psychological safety, if you&#8217;re a leader, you know that that&#8217;s something that is built over time and requires a lot of trust and a lot of conversations with people that you&#8217;re working with, and we can&#8217;t quite do that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so Chatham House Rule builds an environment that helps create that suddenly in the moment and requires, you know, some, some faith in one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But basically, no one can be quoted about what they said in those conversations. No one&#8217;s examples can be attributed to them. But the conversations can be summarized and published, which we do on the Community Summit website. And then, we publish those for our collective knowledge over time. This lets folks who are attending advocate for themselves and others fully without worrying over whether they&#8217;re gonna be taken out of context later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, one of the biggest questions we get ahead of any Community Summit is why it is by invitation only. The most commonly cited reasons for keeping this small and invite only have everything to do with logistics and leadership. You want it to be large enough to have good representation but small enough to have high-quality interactions. It&#8217;s just a really narrow Goldilocks moment, if you will.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:00]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that reason doesn&#8217;t necessarily address the need for invitations rather than letting it be first come, first served. The reason for that is more of a philosophical one and requires you to go on a mini historical journey with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also has changed a bit over the years. The first ever Community Summit, way back in 2012, was before my time, but if I recall my history correctly, it was truly by invitation only. The summit after that included a closed nomination process. The next included a team nomination process, and then the last two, 2017 and 2023, have included open nominations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, even in the nomination era of Community Summit organizing, there is still a selection process. The organizers review the list of suggested attendees and check for the same types of things we expect major WordCamp organizers to look for in their speaker selection.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:00]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things like which teams they contribute to, what communities they advocate for, and how long they&#8217;ve been a member of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then they adjust for balance. In addition to those things, there are also four types of voices that we always want represented at our Community Summit. So first is leading voices, people who are already in the community and kind of are helping us to make decisions. I am considered one of those leading voices; I have put in my application to be included in the Community Summit. Really hope we select me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one is future leading voices. Specifically, those are people who are active in the community already and are showing a lot of promise, either because they really understand the values that the WordPress open source project is putting forward or understand the basic processes of communicating and guiding people in such a complex ecosystem as the WordPress project represents. Or because they have said quite plainly they are interested in helping us to make sure that the WordPress project is able to move and continue to create and continue to support democratizing publishing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:00]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a little bit potentially folks who are self-selecting for that. People who already are showing that they are doing that either in WordPress or in their local communities. That&#8217;s one of the types of voices we want to include. A third one that we want to include all the time is voices we need, so voices that we need to hear. People that specifically we are building WordPress for, people that have indicated to us that the CMS is not necessarily perfect for some of the use cases that they run into regularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the people and users and community organizers that can and are able to advocate for the types of user interactions, the types of community interactions that we absolutely want to be able to see.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s a third group of voices that we want to make sure we have represented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the fourth and final group that we always want to have represented is a group that I call voices we miss. And so those are the people that we want to be able to hear more from in our project that we don&#8217;t necessarily either have a good group of representative voices for, so it&#8217;s hard to hear them, or that we know are probably users of the CMS or they are attending events, they are somehow involved in the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we don&#8217;t necessarily have any way to have accounted for them while we were building solutions way back in 2012 or 2006 when things were being built for us. And so those are the four groups of people, the four types of voices that I absolutely want to have represented at our Community Summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:00]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I ask organizers to go through this incredibly complicated selection process because we want not simply a microcosm of the WordPress community as we see it today and hope to see it in the future but also an equitably voiced forum during that critical problem definition phase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So TLDL. For, listen?! T L D Real Listen. Although if you didn&#8217;t make it through that, you definitely are not getting to this point. So a TLDR for folks who skimmed the transcript and got here, I guess we keep this invitation structure because we want to account for voices we don&#8217;t hear every day in the WordPress project. Not because we don&#8217;t value them but because we already hear them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now that brings us to our small list of big things. This week it&#8217;s actually kind of a big list of big things, but you know, there it is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>First things first. The applications for the Community Summit are now open. Those are the applications to attend. It&#8217;s pretty short. I filled mine out this morning and it&#8217;s three questions about who you are and your username on wordpress.org, and then three questions about the topics you are most interested in and the experience that you have in those conversations so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. It took me, like, I think, 90 seconds. Like, a full minute and a half. So head on over there. We have a link in the show notes, but also, you&#8217;ll be able to find it in newsletters across the entire WordPress media ecosystem. I am pretty sure about that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that there is a proposal out for a project-wide mentorship program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a huge potential win for us. It is aiming to fix some of our broken ladders. If you&#8217;re not familiar with my Broken Ladder Theory of the WordPress project, I&#8217;ll try to remember to find a link to that post and put that in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number three is that Openverse moved. I shared this last week that happened last week. They didn&#8217;t move very far, though. They have a new URL, you can find them at openverse.org. It&#8217;s the same team. It&#8217;s the same product. It&#8217;s the same group of excellent openly-licensed images and media that you have come to expect. It just has its own standalone URL now. Huge kudos to the contributors who got that done.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing that happened last week is that WordPress 6.2 has moved into its beta phase, and so now is the time to get out there and test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There also was an excellent, excellent write-up about how to test any given release. And I think it also includes how to file a good bug. And so we&#8217;ll send all of those things into the show notes. They&#8217;ll be easy to find. Get out there and do your testing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And number five, longest, small list of big things in recent history.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got some interest on [a] women, and non-binary led release for 2023, and so since there was some interest shown for that, it is hereby verbally confirmed.

From that small spark, he now enjoys an interesting and varied career in Brazil and beyond, and an ever-expanding community network. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following WordPress and its new features fascinates Daniel and he is always looking for ways to share what it has to offer with others. His initial focus on WordPress for content publishing soon became a wider appreciation of the platform’s capacity for building communities and careers.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel has served as a community organizer for seven years in Curitiba, Brazil and co-organized four annual <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Translation Day</a> events in the city. Community building initiatives, like these, bring in new volunteers and help spur on local user groups.<br><br>Now working as a software engineer manager, Daniel maintains his interest in supporting the WordPress community through a newsletter in Brazilian Portuguese.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Finding WordPress to publish content can be life-changing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel&#8217;s web development skills were initially self-taught, and built on his interest in technology and from his earlier interest in video games. He developed systems in ASP and PHP, and created online resources to teach others how to create websites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the time came to choose his academic path, he had no doubt that it would be something related to computers and picked Computer Science at the Federal University of Paraná.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“In order to focus more on content rather than coding, I ended up getting to know WordPress. It was love at first sight!” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2009, he launched a public blog about films that became a hub for cultural content related to cinema, literature, and comics. The blog had collaborators from several cities in the country. He found WordPress an easy tool for publishing articles. It allowed him to spend more time on writing content rather than having to use his software engineering skills to write code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, once he discovered the range and versatility of the software, he wanted to build themes and features to customize websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he searched for learning materials, he came across a WordPress event happening in his own city. This event, <a href=\"https://curitiba.wordcamp.org/2010/\">WordCamp Curitiba 2010</a>, had a deep impact on Daniel.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“Other tech events I attended charged more than double this WordCamp, but hadn’t offered half of the things it did.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel was inspired not only by the talks but also the kindness shown by others at the event. His inherent shyness meant he had to step out of his comfort zone to socialize. However, the friendliness of attendees and the welcome he received made this less foreboding. He was hooked by the community he met, and he pledged to volunteer at the next WordCamp and even apply as a speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2018-wc-saopaulo-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Daniel giving a talk at WordCamp São Paulo 2018 \n\" class=\"wp-image-14223\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2018-wc-saopaulo-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2018-wc-saopaulo-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2018-wc-saopaulo-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2018-wc-saopaulo-2.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Daniel giving a talk at WordCamp São Paulo 2018 about Gutenberg</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Less than two years later, Daniel helped to organize <a href=\"https://curitiba.wordcamp.org/2012/\">WordCamp in Curitiba 2012</a>, and this was where he gave his first public talk. It was an important moment in his journey. He is determined to keep improving his public speaking skills each time he presents, and help others to do so too. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">From WordPress user to entrepreneur</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel had dreamed of starting his own company since childhood. Following his university graduation in 2011, he decided to fulfil that dream. He started a web development company, envisioning it as a creative project lab.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, he worked with a variety of systems and programming languages. Soon, he realized that maintaining multiple solutions took considerable time and effort. So he opted to use a single platform, WordPress. It offered ease of use for his clients and the possibility of offering various types of websites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This decision allowed me to dive even deeper into the system, making better and faster-to-deliver solutions for my clients,” said Daniel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the company grew, he expanded the services it offered to include support, maintenance, courses, consulting, and optimized hosting for WordPress. This gave Daniel access to a wider range of clients and greater specialization in the WordPress platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even as a small company, Daniel wanted to give back to the WordPress community. Through using this open source software, the business had not faced the costs of using commercial platforms. He felt he should invest back into the software and its community it as much as he could, from sponsorship of events to collaborating in the Contributor Teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2018-wc-floripa.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-14221\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2018-wc-floripa.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2018-wc-floripa.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2018-wc-floripa.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2018-wc-floripa.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>His community contributions include speaking at meetups and WordCamps to share what what he has learned in his day-to-day work. “It was always and still is a big pleasure to be able to make these contributions,” he affirmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, he decided to close his company after eight years and start a new chapter in Development Coordination. His focus continues to be on WordPress, both professionally and in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Supporting local: re-energising the Curitiba’s WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2016-meetup-curitiba.jpg?resize=680%2C510&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Daniel speaking at a meetup in Curitiba in 2016.\" class=\"wp-image-14241\" width=\"680\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2016-meetup-curitiba.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2016-meetup-curitiba.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2016-meetup-curitiba.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2016-meetup-curitiba.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Daniel speaking at a meetup in Curitiba in 2016</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After WordCamp in Curitiba in 2012, the community there took a break from organizing events. Three years later, Daniel was eager to help restart meetups in Curitiba. He connected with others in the Brazilian community to find a way forward to support both end users of WordPress and firms using the platform. Through instant messaging tool Slack, a rebooted meetup was organized in August 2015. All the planning was done virtually and they only met for the first time in person on the day of the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although they did not have much initial experience in event planning, the meetup organizers were determined attendees should have fun and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere. They wanted people to feel comfortable socializing and to chat before and after the talks. The tips that attendees shared at every meeting were one of the most successful elements of these user-focused meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Daniel, getting up in front of people to introduce the meetup was still not easy. However, he knew continuing to practice and improve his self-confidence was the only way to overcome his shyness. This determination and sense of achievement inspires him to encourage others to present talks and share the tips he uses when presenting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/wpcuritiba/\">Curitiba meetup</a> continues to flourish. Though Daniel has moved to supporting the community in new ways, he has a lasting fondness for it. It has made him an advocate for local groups at the heart of the WordPress community. He believes the shared interest and enthusiasm for learning at meetups helps to increase attendees&#8217; interest in both the software and its community, and their willingness to participate .</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sharing the benefit of WordPress across Brazil</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2019-meetup-curitiba-4.jpg?resize=680%2C411&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Daniel presenting at a Curitiba meetup in 2019.\" class=\"wp-image-14242\" width=\"680\" height=\"411\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2019-meetup-curitiba-4.jpg?w=991&amp;ssl=1 991w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2019-meetup-curitiba-4.jpg?resize=300%2C182&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/01/daniel-kossmann-2019-meetup-curitiba-4.jpg?resize=768%2C465&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Daniel presenting at a Curitiba meetup in 2019</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In June 2019, Daniel created a newsletter to spread content about WordPress in Brazilian Portuguese and inspire others to create content in the language. Translating, Daniel believes is a powerful way to make WordPress more accessible to people who do not speak English, which is the case for a lot of people in Brazil. In 2021, Daniel started writing regularly about WordPress on his blog too. He continues to publish weekly news, tutorials, tips, and share events. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Advice to future WordPress contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel believes that the WordPress community is a key strength of the platform. It attracts people with a range of technical skills and backgrounds, and strives to have a diverse and open space for exchange. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many ways to contribute to WordPress without working with the code. He said: “I&#8217;m a big evangelizer of learning in public. A great way to collaborate is to create your blog in WordPress itself and share your journey of using it, and to write about tips and useful resources. This will eventually lead you to the official WordPress documentation and, the more you use it, the more opportunities for improvements you will see. Then you can start contributing to improving it. Besides this, you can pick a plugin or theme that you use and help with its translation.&#8221;<br><br>He added: “My biggest advice for those who are starting to contribute to WordPress is to start with a small step, maybe solving an easy bug or fixing a typo, and create a routine to consistently work on it, like an hour every weekend.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniel has made several lasting friendships, received professional referrals through his participation in community events, and enjoys a career that continues to have variety and new things to learn. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His final message is to join WordPress <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/topics/wordpress/\">meetups locally</a> or online in other cities, and be inspired like he has been for 14 years and still counting. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/kossmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>kossmann</a> for sharing his adventures in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>) for research, interviews, and writing this feature article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>People of WordPress</em> series thanks Josepha Haden (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>chanthaboune</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>topher1kenobe</a>) for their support.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\" style=\"grid-template-columns:29% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/heropress_logo_180.png?resize=180%2C135&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" class=\"wp-image-8409 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve barely gotten moving here in 2023, but even so, WordPress is already working toward its next major release– coming to us at the end of March. You&#8217;ve probably heard by now that with this release comes the “end of Phase 2.” But for a lot of folks, that&#8217;s raising some questions about what to expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:00]&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m gonna spend a little time today sharing what I currently know. Let&#8217;s start with what that phrase does mean. Firstly, all of the projects, with the exception of two, I believe, in the Phase 2 scoping ticket, will be shipped in the Gutenberg plugin before WordPress 6.2 release comes out. Barring any major breaking issues, those will then land in that major release in WordPress 6.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, like, 99% of the features we considered in scope for Phase 2 will be in core by April. It also means the block editor may finally shed its beta label. We&#8217;ve been discussing that possibility with the input of the community over the course of the last few major releases, and we&#8217;ll do the same as we get ready for the 6.2 release as well. That discussion is tracked over in GitHub, and I can share a link to that in the show notes. For anyone who is a little super nerd, like me, the ticket number is 39293.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So not only if you&#8217;re going to memorize it and be one of those cool WordPressers who can call tickets to mind based on the numbers. This is a good one because not only is it an important topic, to be able to recall, but also it&#8217;s a palindrome, so you get to be fancy and know that forever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, I&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes for all the rest of us. Fingers crossed that we get to remove that label this time around, but also, the acceptance criteria on it are pretty clear. So it&#8217;s really a matter of yes or no on all of the columns all the way down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what does that phase <em>not</em> mean? Firstly, it does not mean that we will stop accepting user feedback or bug reports on any features up to this point. It is always encouraged to file a ticket on track or GitHub detailing any bugs that you&#8217;ve encountered. If you&#8217;ve never reported a bug before, don&#8217;t worry. We have all been there. I&#8217;ll gather a link or two with some information for first-timers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you ever run into me at a WordCamp, feel free to ask me about my first bug-reporting experience. And after you&#8217;ve heard that, you will immediately go and file that bug that has been sitting screenshotted on your desk for six months because it honestly cannot get any worse than my first one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, it definitely does not mean that we will stop shipping refinements to the user experience. As much as I&#8217;d like to say this isn&#8217;t true, I think all open source contributors know that no matter how much you test a solution, you can&#8217;t actually account for all possible use cases when you work on a project this size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as we find things that we didn&#8217;t realize were a little rough to use, we will, of course, make the effort to smooth those workflows as quickly as possible. So that&#8217;s my little reassuring tl;dr for what that phrase means. If you are listening to this and haven&#8217;t spent much time in the block editor as it exists today, I encourage you to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has really changed substantially since it was first merged in 2018, and it represents thousands of hours of research and problem-solving and creation, and outreach. If you know someone who has contributed to the project or whose content helped you make sense of some inscrutable part of it, also maybe, drop them a line and let them know you appreciate their hard work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:26]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. Firstly, we are thinking a lot right now about the paths to contribution. Both at the start of your contribution journey and as you grow into a long-term, seasoned contributor. There are a couple of different discussions related to that right now. So there are actually two project-wide discussions that are on make.wordpress.org/project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there&#8217;s one that is specific to WordCamp membership, and that is on make.wordpress.org/community. You can head over to any of those and share your experiences, thoughts, and any wild ideas that you have.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on my small list is that there are a lot of pages across wordpress.org that are getting shiny new designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to get involved in those discussions, or you just wanna catch early previews of what&#8217;s coming to the site, you can hop over to make.wordpress.org/design or join the design team meetings in Slack.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the last thing is that WordCamp Asia is coming quickly, my friends. This event is near and dear to my heart. I hope to see a lot of you in person, but if you won&#8217;t be able to make it in person, we still have you covered. There will be a live stream, and the schedule for that is already on the site. It shows the times for each session in your local time zone so you can easily decide which presentations you absolutely must see right in the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"14213\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"The Month in WordPress – December 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/01/the-month-in-wordpress-december-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 19 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=14191\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:339:\"Last month at State of the Word, WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy shared some opening thoughts on “Why WordPress” and the Four Freedoms of open source.

The reasons that a solopreneur will choose WordPress are different than the reasons a corporation would. And while artists and activists may have a similar vision for the world, their motivations change their reasons, too. That&#8217;s why I always focus on the philosophical parts of the answer because I know that I am speaking as an advocate for many types of WordPressers. I have a few other reasons, too, which you may not be aware of as you use our software every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why WordPress?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most importantly, the Four Freedoms of Open Source. If you have already listened to State of the Word, you have heard my thoughts on the philosophical side of open source and the freedoms it provides. If you didn’t, then the tl;dr on that is that open source provides protections and freedoms to creators on the web that should be a given. There&#8217;s an extent to which the idea of owning your content and data online is a radical idea. So radical, even, that it is hard for folks to grasp what we mean when we say &#8220;free as in speech, not free as in beer.&#8221; Securing an open web for the future is, I believe, a net win for the world especially when contrasted to the walled gardens and proprietary systems that pit us all against one another with the purpose of gaining more data to sell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second reason is that WordPress entrepreneurs (those providing services, designing sites, and building applications) have proven that open source offers an ethical framework for conducting business. No one ever said that you cannot build a business using free and open source software. And I am regularly heartened by the way successful companies and freelancers make an effort to pay forward what they can. Not always for the sole benefit of WordPress, but often for the general benefit of folks learning how to be an entrepreneur in our ecosystem. Because despite our competitive streaks, at the end of the day, we know that ultimately we are the temporary caretakers of an ecosystem that has unlocked wealth and opportunity for people we may never meet but whose lives are made infinitely better because of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final reason is that leaders in the WordPress community (team reps, component maintainers, and community builders) have shown that open source ideals can be applied to how we work with one another. As a community, we tend to approach solution gathering as an “us vs. the problem” exercise, which not only makes our solutions better and our community stronger. And our leaders—working as they are in a cross-cultural, globally-distributed project that guides or supports tens of thousands of people a year—have unparalleled generosity of spirit. Whether they are welcoming newcomers or putting out calls for last-minute volunteers, seeing the way that they collaborate every day gives me hope for our future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I have witnessed these three things work together over the years, one thing is clear to me: not only is open source an idea that can change our generation by being an antidote to proprietary systems and the data economy, open source methodologies represent a process that can change the way we approach our work and our businesses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress in 2023</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As we prepare for the third phase of the Gutenberg project, we are putting on our backend developer hats and working on the APIs that power our workflows. Releases during Phase 3 will focus on the main elements of collaborative user workflows. If that doesn’t make sense, think of built-in real-time collaboration, commenting options in drafts, easier browsing of post revisions, and programmatic editorial and pre-launch checklists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Phases 1 and 2 had a &#8220;blocks everywhere&#8221; vision, think of Phase 3 with more of a “works with the way you work” vision.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to this halfway milestone of starting work on Phase 3, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wp20.wordpress.net/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress also hits the milestone of turning 20 years old</a>. I keep thinking back to various milestones we&#8217;ve had (which you can read about in the second version of the Milestones book) and realized that almost my entire experience of full-time contributions to WordPress has been in the Gutenberg era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I hear some of you already thinking incredulous thoughts so, come with me briefly.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a couple of different moments that folks point to as the beginning of the Gutenberg project. Some say it was at State of the Word 2013 when Matt dreamed of &#8220;a true WYSIWYG&#8221; editor for WordPress. Some say it was at State of the Word 2016 where we were encouraged to &#8220;learn Javascript deeply.&#8221; For many of us, it was at WordCamp Europe in 2017 when the Gutenberg demo first made its way on stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter when you first became aware of Gutenberg, I can confirm that it feels like a long time because it has been a long time. I can also confirm that it takes many pushes to knock over a refrigerator. For early adopters (both to the creation of Gutenberg and its use), hyper-focus on daily tasks makes it hard to get a concept of scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I encourage you this year to look out toward the horizon and up toward our guiding stars.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month at State of the Word, I shared some opening thoughts about why WordPress. For me, this is an easy question, and the hardest part is always knowing which lens to answer through. Though I always focus on the philosophical parts of the answer, I know that I often speak as an advocate for many types of WordPressers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as we prepare ourselves for the start of a new year, I have a few additional thoughts that I&#8217;d like to share with you, my WordPress community, to take into the year with you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, the Four Freedoms. If you have already listened to State of the Word, you have heard my take on the philosophical side of open source and the freedoms it provides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you didn&#8217;t, then the TL;DR on that is that open source provides protections and freedoms to creators on the web that I really think should just be a given. But there are a couple of other things about the Four Freedoms, and especially the way that WordPress does this kind of open source-y thing that I think are worth noting as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of those things is that WordPress entrepreneurs, those who are providing services or designing sites, building applications, they have proven that open source provides an ethical framework for conducting business. No one ever said that you aren&#8217;t allowed to build a business using free and open source software, and I am regularly heartened by the way that successful companies and freelancers make the effort to pay forward what they can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not always for the sole benefit of WordPress, of course, but often for the general benefit of folks who are also learning how to be entrepreneurs or how to kind of navigate our ecosystem. And the other thing that I love about the Four Freedoms and the way that WordPress does it is that leaders in the WordPress community, no matter where they are leading from, have shown that open source ideals can be applied to the way we work with one another and show up for one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a community, we tend to approach solution gathering as an us-versus-the-problem exercise, which not only makes our solutions better, it also makes our community stronger.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I have witnessed all of these things work together over the years, one thing that is clear to me is this: not only is open source an idea that can change our generation by being an antidote to proprietary systems and the data economy, but open source methodologies represent a process that can change the way we approach our work and our businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:01]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second big thing that I want to make sure you all take into the year with you is that we are preparing for the third phase of the Gutenberg project. We are putting our backend developer hats on and working on the APIs that power our workflows. That workflows phase will be complex. A little bit because APIs are dark magic that binds us together, but also because we&#8217;re going to get deep into the core of WordPress with that phase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to have impactful work for future users of WordPress, though, this is the phase to get invested in. This phase will focus on the main elements of collaborative user workflows. If that doesn&#8217;t really make sense to you, I totally get it. Think of it this way, this phase will work on built-in real-time collaboration, commenting options in drafts, easier browsing of post revisions, and things like programmable editorial, pre-launch checklists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So phases one and two of the Gutenberg project had a very ‘blocks everywhere’ sort of vision. And phase three and, arguably, phase four will have more of a ‘works with the way you work’ vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my final thought for you all as we head into the year is this, there are a couple of different moments that folks point to as the beginning of the Gutenberg project. Some say it was State of the Word 2013, where Matt dreamed on stage of a true WYSIWYG editor for WordPress. Some say it was State of the Word 2016, where we were all encouraged to learn JavaScript deeply. For a lot of us though, it was at WordCamp Europe in 2018 when the Gutenberg feature plugin first made its way to the repo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter when you first became aware of Gutenberg, I can confirm that it feels like it&#8217;s been a long time because it has been a long time. But I can also confirm that it takes many pushes to knock over a refrigerator.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For early adopters, both to the creation of Gutenberg as well as its use, hyperfocus on daily tasks makes it really hard to get a concept of scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I encourage everyone this year to look out toward the horizon a bit more and up toward our guiding stars a bit more as well. Because we are now, as we ever were, securing opportunity for those who come after us because of the opportunity that was secured for us by those who came before us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. It&#8217;s a very small list, but two pretty big things. The first thing on the list is that the WordPress 6.2 release is on its way. If you would like to get started contributing there, you can wander over to make.WordPress.org/core. You can volunteer to be part of the release squad. You can volunteer your time just as a regular contributor, someone who can test things &#8212; any of that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll put a link in the show notes. And the second thing that I wanted to remind you of is that today is the deadline to submit topics for the Community Summit that&#8217;s coming up in August. That comes up in the middle of August, like the 22nd and 23rd or something like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll put a link to that in the show notes as well. If you already have chatted with a team rep about some things that you really want to make sure get discussed at the community summit, I think that we can all assume that your team rep has put that in. But if not, it never hurts to give it a second vote by putting a new submission into the form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"14175\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"WordPress is Turning 20: Let’s Celebrate!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/01/wordpress-is-turning-20-lets-celebrate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 21:38:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"WP20\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=14155\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"2023 marks the 20th year of WordPress.

This is the thing I&#8217;ve done 25 times, and I know how to do it for reals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to WordPress Briefing, episode 20. Oh no, 7? 27? 26? Episode 27. I know how many things I&#8217;ve done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ooh, neat. This is Josepha recording episode 46 of the WP Bonus Briefings. Not because we&#8217;ve had 46 bonus Briefings, but because this is the 46th one and it is a bonus, it will also have a fancy name. But right now, I&#8217;m just calling it the bonus. It&#8217;s gonna be quick. Here I go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group them into two big buckets, themes, uh, themes and tools. Mmm, I&#8217;m gonna have to redo the whole thing! No! I thought I could save it, and I didn&#8217;t save it. I had a typo in my script, and then I messed it up. I, it said into you big buckets instead of into two big buckets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna start over from the target release date because I kind of smeared it all together, um, despite what I intended to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And gives everyone, no. What is this ringing of phones? Oh, I was doing so well. Where was I? Let&#8217;s see if I can just pick it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All righty, live from my closet. It&#8217;s episode 20, the WordPress Briefing, WP Briefing. So I have a title for this, and when I started writing it, I really had every intention of writing it to the title. And then what I wrote doesn&#8217;t fit the title at all, but does really hang together well. And so we&#8217;re gonna have to come up with a new title, but at the moment, it&#8217;s called So Many Ways to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here in a minute, you will see why it doesn&#8217;t fit. Also, at the end, I feel like I get very, like, angry nerd leader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:00]&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I may, I may at the end, give that a second go and see if there&#8217;s a way that I can soften it a little bit, but, I, I don&#8217;t know that I can soften it. I feel very strongly about it. So, maybe I am just an angry nerd leader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, okay. I&#8217;ll get us started now that I apparently have filled the room with apologies, not the room, the closet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll figure out something very catchy as a title or as an alternative. Very descriptive, and people will click on it because they must know, but we&#8217;ll figure out the title later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>@wordpress.org. However, I don&#8217;t know why I decided to do an invitation to email me in the middle of that. I&#8217;m gonna start from the top of that paragraph. I just got too excited by the opportunity to get mail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I gotta slow it down. I&#8217;m like the fastest talker, had too much coffee. Okay, slowing it down now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huh? What am I saying? No, no, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying. It&#8217;s fine. I, I can do this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:00]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hold on. Oww. Sorry. I was adjusting my microphone, and then it fell down. I happened to be holding it at the time, so it didn&#8217;t, like, slam down, I think, and hurt your ears and so I apologize. Good thing I stopped so it didn&#8217;t just, like, slam down in the middle of a recording.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;m gonna give myself that win, even though it&#8217;s a hollow one. All right. Trying again. Starting right there, at now since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, it starts on October 18th, 2001. That&#8217;s the year? No, 2021. That&#8217;s the year. Oh man. I&#8217;m doing such a great job of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I&#8217;m recording this slightly before, um, you&#8217;re hearing it? What, how am I gonna start this? Hold on. I don&#8217;t know how to start this. All right. I&#8217;m, I can do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;m so glad I remembered. We had guests that could have been so embarrassing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now for me, the trade-offs work well. How many times can I say now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do I just start every sentence with now now? Is this just how I do things? Uh, now, now, now, now. I&#8217;m gonna start all over again because I&#8217;m in my head about the words in my mouth now. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some near timeframe, some near timeframe. This is not a thing that people say, Dustin, I&#8217;m sorry. That&#8217;s not a thing people say. I&#8217;m just gonna retry that one sentence to sound like I speak with other human beings sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is the start of… I can do these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a terrible ending. I need to just finish that last part. I&#8217;m gonna redo the part where I started with my name and not the name of the podcast. Um, and we&#8217;ll do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re supporting or building anything to hand off to clients, you know that timely, easy to ship changes on a site are considered a vital part of any overarching brand and marketing strategy. Wow. It&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know what words are right there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tripped over my own tongue a lot. I&#8217;m gonna sit, I&#8217;m gonna do that paragraph again because I didn&#8217;t do a very good job of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll do a better job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I literally digress, and now I don&#8217;t know. I am in my thing. What was I saying? Oh, there we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Topher DeRosia, who founded Word not WordPress. Holy moly. That was a, I knew I was gonna say that, and I was like, don&#8217;t say that when you actually get around to saying this, but here I am, and I did it. Even though I knew I was gonna do it and I told myself not to. Doing it again. Right from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not which audiench segment. Oh man. Audiench is not a word, folks. I was on a roll. I&#8217;m gonna start right from the primary thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t even remember how I started this podcast. What is the last thing I said? I said, here we go. All right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kind of covered some interesting ground, and so, oh no, this is not where I&#8217;m gonna start it. I know exactly where I&#8217;m gonna start it. Okay. I&#8217;m really ready now. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suddenly, I&#8217;m gonna pause right here because I suddenly got really worried that I didn&#8217;t actually hit record. Oh my gosh. I did. Woo. I&#8217;m all over the place. Okay. We&#8217;ll now continue. Wait, did I? Oh my goodness. I did, super sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m gonna do some singing in the middle of some talking, but I keep trying to talk myself out of the singing, so I&#8217;m gonna go ahead and do the singing, and then I&#8217;ll do the talking before I talk myself out of the singing. Here I go, probably.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I added a word. That was so good. I&#8217;m gonna start again. I&#8217;m gonna get some water, and then I&#8217;m gonna start again. Not again. Again. Just from the ‘and finally.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how I finish my show. Y&#8217;all, I do this literally every week. I never know how to finish my show. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know why I shouted at you from the other side of the tiny closet. I apologize. I&#8217;m gonna start again from ‘and finally.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tada we did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ha. I hate it. I hate the whole podcast. It&#8217;s gonna be fine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Done. Nailed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that, I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Merry Christmas from me. Happy holidays to you, and we&#8217;ll see you again in the new year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Done.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"14123\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"https://wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:4:\"site\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"14607090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:11:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 20:26:32 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:25:\"strict-transport-security\";s:11:\"max-age=360\";s:6:\"x-olaf\";s:3:\"⛄\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 17:18:37 GMT\";s:4:\"link\";s:63:\"<https://wordpress.org/news/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\"\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211220193300\";}','no');

It has communictor lot of bells adobe visual communicator 3 free download whistles that give the user the potential to create video above the standard quality expectations of online video i.</p>\n<p>The application is powerful and user-friendly, but the additional styled themes, music and graphics are somewhat outdated. It appears that this old Serious Magic software may not have had a full makeover when Adobe took over several years ago. The install was a snap. To be adobe visual communicator 3 free download, there are a few gems you can use for a variety of projects. The GUI is well laid out. In the left corner is the preview monitor, which shows you how the graphics and video will play out and also plays the role of the program monitor for rehearsal and playback, giving you adobe visual communicator 3 free download live view of the program video.</p>\n<p>To the right of the preview monitor are the TelePrompTer and the vertical bar that holds the titles, effects and graphics. These two scroll together during your production. This brilliant part of the software allows the talent to read the script via an easy-to-read TelePrompTer, with upcoming visual changes scrolling upwards.</p>\n<p>In this method, timing <a href=\"https://heropress.com/18672.txt\">hp deskjet 2050 driver free for windows 10</a> everything, and the Rehearse and Review buttons are key to fine-tuning your delivery.</p>\n<p>The next bunch of Adove windows gives the user full control of settings, media and effects. Here the GUI seems a little crowded, mostly because of downpoad many options. On the left-lower side are the main program details, from project information to individual visual-effect controls.</p>\n<p>On the adobe visual communicator 3 free download side, a basic browser window gives you instant access to all critical media, effects, styles and more.</p>\n<p>The oversized program clock at bottom left counts up during rehearsal and recording and reminds us of one important web video quality: brevity. We really like this feature. Attention to detail shows in Visual Communicator 3. We quickly found a few favorites. First, the advance setup for video sources is a nice touch, allowing you to adjust the video image from a webcam or video camcorder. You can adjust brightness, color, contrast and more to give downloar video the necessary adjustments, so that it really pops.</p>\n<p>Manipulating the lighting is your best bet for creating stunning images. V-Screen, a greenscreen utility, pulls a key from a live video source quickly and easily. Put up adobe visual communicator 3 free download green sheet, and V-Screen creates an alpha channel and runs a new graphic, dynamic animation or video.</p>\n<p>If you plan to use a high-definition camcorder, make sure you can switch it into standard-definition mode. We preferred an external camcorder for control of <a href=\"https://heropress.com/36491.txt\">/36491.txt</a> length and positioning, although the other options are perfect for schools or for down-and-dirty, quick setups. Mixing three input sources gives advanced users plenty of possibilities.</p>\n<p>We found the preferred distance from on-camera talent to TelePrompTer screen and camcorder to be about 5 feet, giving the talent a better eye line into the camcorder. Even from 5 feet away, the prompter text <a href=\"https://heropress.com/633.txt\">здесь</a> easy to read. When you use a webcam embedded into a laptop, the eye-line problem is reduced, as the camera eye is closer to the prompter text.</p>\n<p>Audio inputs <a href=\"https://heropress.com/8495.txt\">нажмите чтобы перейти</a> come from your camcorder, webcam if it has a micUSB microphone or the mic input on your computer. Audio setup will help you choose the source, adjust volume and decide whether or not to bypass the computer speakers.</p>\n<p>We were pleased with the ease of use. <a href=\"https://heropress.com/7229.txt\">Ссылка на продолжение</a> text to the TelePrompTer from a script takes a simple copy-and-paste. Adding comunicator or a simple graphic was a snap: drag and drop. Building your project tends to slow down when you introduce effects, titles and transitions. If you adobe visual communicator 3 free download clmmunicator appropriate number and use the Favorites folder, you can save yourself some hassle.</p>\n<p>When all is perfectly timed and rehearsed, the Record button activates a countdown leader, so you can take position. You can stop recording if something goes wrong.

Other users in that thread put forth many propositions that coreldraw graphics suite 2018 vs 2017 free later be part of the final file fgee.</p>\n<p>Other suggestions later implemented included the deflate compression algorithm and bit color support, the lack of the latter usite GIF also motivating the team to create their file format. The group would become known as the PNG Development Group, and as the discussion rapidly expanded, it later used a mailing list associated with a CompuServe forum. The specification was revised on 31 December as version 1.</p>\n<p>Version 1. MNG achieved moderate application support, but not enough among mainstream web browsers and no usage among web site designers or publishers. With coreldraw graphics suite 2018 vs 2017 free all major browsers now support APNG.</p>\n<p>Coreldraw graphics suite 2018 vs 2017 free original PNG specification was authored by 2071 ad hoc group of computer graphics experts and enthusiasts. Discussions and decisions about the format were conducted by email. The original authors listed on RFC are: [12]. A PNG file starts with an 8- byte signature [13] refer to hex editor image on the right :. After the header, comes a series of chunks[14] each of which conveys certain information about the image.</p>\n<p>Chunks declare themselves as critical or ancillaryand a program encountering an ancillary chunk that it does not understand can safely ignore it. This chunk-based storage layer grapics, similar in concept to a container format or to Amiga &#8216; s IFFis designed to allow the PNG format to be extended while maintaining compatibility with older versions—it provides forward compatibilityand this same file structure with different signature and chunks is used in the associated MNGJNGand APNG formats.</p>\n<p>The case of the different letters in the name bit 5 of the numeric value of the character is a bit field that provides the decoder with some information on the nature of chunks it does not recognize.</p>\n<p>The case of the first letter indicates whether the chunk is critical or not. If the first letter is uppercase, the chunk is critical; if not, the chunk is ancillary. Critical chunks contain information that is necessary to read the file. If a decoder encounters a critical chunk it does not recognize, it must abort reading the file or supply the user with an appropriate warning. The case of the second letter indicates whether the chunk is &#8220;public&#8221; either in the specification or the registry of special-purpose 22018 chunks or &#8220;private&#8221; not standardised.</p>\n<p>Uppercase is public and lowercase is private. This ensures that public and private chunk names can never conflict with each other although two private chunk names could conflict. The third letter must be uppercase to conform to the PNG specification. Coreldraw graphics suite 2018 vs 2017 free is reserved for future expansion. Decoders should treat a chunk with a lower case third letter grahics same as any other unrecognised chunk.</p>\n<p>The case of the fourth letter indicates whether the chunk is safe to copy by editors that do not recognize it. If lowercase, the chunk may coreldraw graphics suite 2018 vs 2017 free safely copied regardless of the extent of modifications to the file. Coreeldraw uppercase, it may only be copied if the modifications have not touched any critical chunks. As stated in <a href=\"https://heropress.com/30540.txt\">microsoft outlook 2013 email setup free download</a> World Wide Web Consortiumbit depth is defined as &#8220;the number of bits per sample or per palette index not per pixel &#8220;.</p>\n<p>The PLTE chunk is essential for color type 3 indexed color. It is optional for color types 2 and 6 truecolor and truecolor with alpha and it must not appear for color types 0 and 4 grayscale and grayscale with alpha.</p>\n<p>Other image attributes that can be stored in PNG files include gamma values, background color, and textual metadata information. The coreldraw graphics suite 2018 vs 2017 free first letter in these chunks indicates that they are not needed for the PNG specification. The lowercase last letter in some chunks indicates that coreldraw graphics suite 2018 vs 2017 free are safe to copy, even if the application concerned does not understand them.</p>\n<p>Pixels in PNG images are numbers that may be either indices of sample data in the palette or the sample data itself.</p>\n<p>The palette is a separate table contained in the PLTE chunk. Sample data for a single pixel consists of a tuple of between one and four numbers. Coeeldraw the pixel data represents palette indices or explicit sample values, the numbers are referred to as channels and every number in the image is encoded with an identical format. The permitted formats encode each number as an unsigned integer value using graphis fixed number of bits, referred to in the PNG specification as the bit depth.</p>\n<p>Notice that this is not the coreldraw graphics suite 2018 vs 2017 free as color depthwhich is commonly used to refer to the total number of bits in each pixel, not each channel. The permitted bit depths are summarized in the table along with the total number of bits used for each pixel.</p>\n<p>The number of channels depends on whether the image is grayscale or color and whether it has an alpha channel. PNG allows the following combinations of channels, called the color type. The color type is coreldraw graphics suite 2018 vs 2017 free as an 8-bit value however only the low 3 <a href=\"https://heropress.com/35570.txt\">жмите сюда</a> are used and, even then, only the five combinations listed above coreldraw graphics suite 2018 vs 2017 free permitted.</p>\n<p>So long as the color type is valid it can be considered as a bit field as summarized in the adjacent table:. With indexed color images, the palette always stores trichromatic colors at a depth of 8 bits per channel 24 bits per palette entry. Additionally, an optional list of 8-bit alpha values for the palette entries may be included; if not included, or if shorter than the palette, the remaining palette entries <a href=\"https://heropress.com/24206.txt\">источник</a> assumed to be opaque. The palette must not have more entries than the image bit depth allows for, but it may have fewer for example, if an image with 8-bit pixels only uses 90 colors then it does not need palette entries for all colors.</p>\n<p>The palette must contain entries for all the pixel values present in the image. The standard allows indexed color PNGs to have 1, 2, 4 sjite 8 bits per pixel; grayscale images with no alpha channel may have 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 bits per pixel. Everything else uses a bit depth per channel of either 8 or The combinations this allows are given in the table above.</p>\n<p>The standard requires that decoders shite read all supported color formats, but many image editors can only produce a small subset of them. PNG offers a variety of transparency options. With yraphics and grayscale images either a single pixel value can be declared as transparent or an alpha channel can be added enabling any percentage of partial transparency to be used.</p>\n<p>For paletted images, alpha values can be added to palette entries. The number of such values stored may be less than the total number of palette entries, in which case the remaining entries are considered fully opaque.</p>\n<p>The scanning of pixel values for binary transparency is supposed to be performed before any color reduction to avoid pixels becoming unintentionally transparent. This is most likely to pose an issue for systems that can decode bits-per-channel images as is required for compliance with the specification but only output at 8 bits per channel the norm for all but the highest end systems.</p>\n<p>Alpha storage can be &#8220;associated&#8221; &#8221; premultiplied &#8221; or &#8220;unassociated&#8221;, but PNG standardized [29] on &#8220;unassociated&#8221; &#8220;non-premultiplied&#8221; alpha, which means that imagery is not alpha encoded ; the emissions represented in RGB are not the emissions at the pixel level. This means that the over operation will multiply the RGB emissions by the alpha, and cannot represent emission and occlusion properly.</p>\n<p>Compared to formats with lossy compression such as JPEG, choosing a compression setting higher than average delays traphics, but often does not result in a significantly smaller file size. Before DEFLATE is applied, the data is transformed via a prediction method: a single filter method is used for the entire image, while for each image line, a filter type is chosen to transform the data to make it more efficiently compressible. There is only one filter method in the current PNG specification denoted method 0 coredraw, and thus in practice the only choice is which filter type to apply to each line.</p>\n<p>For this method, the filter predicts the value of each pixel based on the values of previous neighboring pixels, and subtracts the predicted color of the pixel from the actual value, as in DPCM. An image line filtered in this way is often more compressible than the raw image line would be, especially if it is similar to the line above, graphiics the differences from prediction will generally be clustered around 0, rather than spread over all possible image values.</p>\n<p>This is particularly important in relating separate rows, since DEFLATE has no understanding that an image is a 2D cireldraw, and instead just sees the image data as a stream of bytes. There <a href=\"https://heropress.com/13216.txt\">супер pdf expert 6 in app purchase free очень</a> five filter types for filter method 0; each type predicts the value of each byte of the image data before filtering based on the corresponding byte of the pixel to the left Athe pixel above Band the pixel above and to the left C or some combination coreldraw graphics suite 2018 vs 2017 free, and encodes the difference between the predicted value and the coreldraw graphics suite 2018 vs 2017 free value.</p>\n<p>Filters are applied to byte values, not pixels; pixel values may be one or two bytes, or several values per byte, but never cross byte boundaries. The filter grapuics are: [31]. The Paeth filter is based on an algorithm by Alan W.</p>\n<p>Compression is coreldraw graphics suite 2018 vs 2017 free improved by choosing filter types adaptively on a line-by-line basis.</p>\n<p>This improvement, and a heuristic method of implementing it commonly <a href=\"https://heropress.com/41073.txt\">мой buffy the vampire slayer pc game конечно</a> by PNG-writing software, were created by Lee Daniel Crockerwho tested the methods on many images during the creation of the format; [33] the coreldraw graphics suite 2018 vs 2017 free of filter is a component of file size optimization, as discussed below. If interlacing is used, each stage of the interlacing is filtered separately, meaning that the image can be progressively rendered as each stage is received; however, interlacing generally makes compression less effective.</p>\n<p>PNG offers an optional 2-dimensional, 7-pass interlacing scheme—the Adam7 algorithm. This is more sophisticated than GIF&#8217;s 1-dimensional, 4-pass scheme, and allows a clearer low-resolution suife to be visible earlier in the transfer, particularly if interpolation algorithms such as bicubic interpolation are used. PNG itself does not support animation. MNG shares PNG&#8217;s basic structure and chunks, but it is significantly more complex and <a href=\"https://heropress.com/41544.txt\">нажмите чтобы узнать больше</a> a different file signature, which automatically renders it incompatible with standard PNG decoders, which <a href=\"https://heropress.com/19013.txt\">источник статьи</a> to MNG to almost have no support or support dropped by most web browsers or applications.</p>\n<p>Today APNG format is currently widely supported by all major web browsers. IEN D. Displayed in the fashion of hex editorswith on the left side byte values shown in hex formatand on the right side their equivalent characters from ISO with unrecognized and control characters replaced with periods. Additionally the PNG signature and individual chunks are marked with colors.</p>\n<p>PNG images coreldraw graphics suite 2018 vs 2017 free less widely supported by older browsers. The JPEG Joint Photographic Experts Group format can produce a smaller file than PNG for photographic and photo-like images, since JPEG uses a lossy encoding method specifically designed for photographic image data, which is graphids dominated by soft, low-contrast transitions, and an amount of noise or similar irregular structures.</p>\n<p>Suiye comparison, when storing images that contain text, line art, or graphics — images with sharp transitions and large areas of solid color — the PNG format can compress image data more than JPEG can. Such artifacts depend corekdraw the settings used in the JPG compression; they can be quite noticeable when a low-quality [high-compression] setting is used. Where an image contains both sharp transitions and photographic parts, a choice must be made between the two effects.</p>\n<p>JPEG does not support transparency. JPEG&#8217;s lossy compression <a href=\"https://heropress.com/4544.txt\">ссылка на продолжение</a> suffers from generation losswhere repeatedly decoding and re-encoding an image to save it again causes a loss of information each time, degrading the image.</p>\n<p>Because PNG is lossless, it is suitable for storing images to be edited. While PNG is reasonably efficient when compressing photographic images, there are lossless compression formats designed specifically for photographic images, lossless WebP and Adobe DNG digital negative for example.</p>\n<p>Coreldraw graphics suite 2018 vs 2017 free these formats are either not widely supported, or are proprietary. An image can be stored losslessly and converted to JPEG format only for distribution, so that there is no generation loss.</p>\n<p>While the PNG specification does not explicitly sutie a standard for embedding Exif image data from sources such as digital cameras, the preferred method for embedding EXIF data in a PNG is to use the non-critical ancillary chunk label eXIf. JPEG was commonly used when exporting images containing gradients for web pages, because of GIF&#8217;s limited color depth.

Version 4 was, however, the first version of Illustrator to support editing in preview mode, which did not appear in a Macintosh version until 5. Version 6 was the last truly Macintosh version of Illustrator.</p>\n<p>The interface changed radically with the following version to bring consistency between Mac and Windows computer platforms. The changes remained until CS6 when some small steps were taken to restore the app to a slightly more Mac-like interface.</p>\n<p>With the introduction of Illustrator 7 in , Adobe made critical changes in the user interface with regard to path editing and also to converge on the same user interface as Adobe Photoshop , and many users opted not to upgrade. Like Photoshop, Illustrator also began supporting plug-ins, greatly and quickly extending its abilities. With true user interface parity between Macintosh and Windows versions starting with 7.</p>\n<p>Adobe bought Aldus in for Page Maker. As a result, Macromedia acquired Free Hand in from its original developer, Altsys , and continued its development through  Illustrator Version 9 included a tracing feature, similar to that within Adobe&#8217;s discontinued product Streamline.</p>\n<p>Illustrator CS aka version 11 , released by Adobe for Mac and Windows in October , was the first version to include 3-dimensional capabilities allowing users to extrude or revolve shapes to create simple 3D objects. It was the last version for the Mac which did not run natively on Intel processors.</p>\n<p>Live Trace allows for the conversion of bitmap imagery into vector art and improved upon the previous tracing abilities. Live Paint allows users more flexibility in applying color to objects, specifically those that overlap. Instead, Adobe would provide tools and support to ease the transition to Illustrator. Illustrator CS3 included interface updates to the Control Bar, the ability to align individual points, multiple Crop Areas, the Color Guide panel and the Live Color feature among others.</p>\n<p>CS3 was released on March 27,  CS4 was released in October  It features a variety of improvements to old tools along with the introduction of a few brand-new tools acquired from FreeHand.</p>\n<p>The ability to create multiple artboards is one of CS4&#8217;s main additions from Freehand. The artboards allow you to create multiple versions of a piece of work within a single document. Other tools include the Blob Brush, which allows multiple overlapping vector brush strokes to easily merge or join, and a revamped gradient tool allowing for more in-depth color manipulation as well as transparency in gradients.</p>\n<p>CS5 was released in April  Along with a number of enhancements to existing functionality, Illustrator CS5&#8217;s new features include a Perspective Grid tool taken from FreeHand, a Bristle Brush for more natural and painterly looking strokes and a comprehensive update to strokes, referred to by Adobe as &#8220;Beautiful Strokes&#8221;. The app had many of the features of Adobe Illustrator, yet it was a free download. This allowed professionals to sketch and ideate &#8220;on the go&#8221; and allowed anyone to access world-class vector drawing capabilities.</p>\n<p>As a result, Facebook and social media posts appeared from all over the world with vector drawings from Adobe Ideas from pros and novices alike. Version CS6 was the 16th generation of Adobe Illustrator. Adobe added many more features and several bug fixes such as a new user interface, layer panels, RGB codes, and color ramp to increase performance. CS6 was released on April 23,  Because PNG is lossless, it is suitable for storing images to be edited. While PNG is reasonably efficient when compressing photographic images, there are lossless compression formats designed specifically for photographic images, lossless WebP and Adobe DNG digital negative for example.</p>\n<p>However these formats are either not widely supported, or are proprietary. An image can be stored losslessly and converted to JPEG format only for distribution, so that there is no generation loss. While the PNG specification does not explicitly include a standard for embedding Exif image data from sources such as digital cameras, the preferred method for embedding EXIF data in a PNG is to use the non-critical ancillary chunk label eXIf.</p>\n<p>JPEG was commonly used when exporting images containing gradients for web pages, because of GIF&#8217;s limited color depth. However, JPEG compression causes a gradient to blur slightly. A PNG format reproduces a gradient as accurately as possible for a given bit depth, while keeping the file size small.</p>\n<p>PNG became the optimal choice for small gradient images as web browser support for the format improved. No images at all are needed to display gradients in modern browsers, as gradients can be created using CSS. It is directly comparable with PNG, [ clarification needed ] and has a standard set of test images. While this makes TIFF useful as a generic format for interchange between professional image editing applications, it makes adding support for it to applications a much bigger task and so it has little support in applications not concerned with image manipulation such as web browsers.</p>\n<p>The high level of extensibility also means that most applications provide only a subset of possible features, potentially creating user confusion and compatibility issues. This compression technique, also used in GIF, was covered by patents until  Compression Tag 16 &#8216; Adobe -style&#8217; with medium usage and support by applications.</p>\n<p>The official reference implementation of the PNG format is the programming library libpng. Therefore, it is usually found as an important system library in free operating systems.</p>\n<p>Adobe Fireworks formerly by Macromedia uses PNG as its native file format, allowing other image editors and preview utilities to view the flattened image. However, Fireworks by default also stores metadata for layers, animation, vector data, text and effects.</p>\n<p>Such files should not be distributed directly. Fireworks can instead export the image as an optimized PNG without the extra metadata for use on web pages, etc. PNG support first appeared in , in Internet Explorer 4. For the complete comparison, see Comparison of web browsers Image format support. Especially versions of Internet Explorer Windows below 9. In addition, Android makes extensive use of PNGs. PNG file size can vary significantly depending on how it is encoded and compressed; this is discussed and a number of tips are given in PNG: The Definitive Guide.</p>\n<p>There is thus a filesize trade-off between high color depth, maximal metadata including color space information, together with information that does not affect display , interlacing, and speed of compression, which all yield large files, with lower color depth, fewer or no ancillary chunks, no interlacing, and tuned but computationally intensive filtering and compression.</p>\n<p>For different purposes, different trade-offs are chosen: a maximal file may be best for archiving and editing, while a stripped down file may be best for use on a website, and similarly fast but poor compression is preferred when repeatedly editing and saving a file, while slow but high compression is preferred when a file is stable: when archiving or posting.</p>\n<p>Interlacing is a trade-off: it dramatically speeds up early rendering of large files improves latency , but may increase file size decrease throughput for little gain, particularly for small files.</p>\n<p>For example, quantizing a truecolor PNG to colors allows the indexed color type to be used for a likely reduction in file size. Some programs are more efficient than others when saving PNG files, this relates to implementation of the PNG compression used by the program.</p>\n<p>Many graphics programs such as Apple&#8217;s Preview software save PNGs with large amounts of metadata and color-correction data that are generally unnecessary for Web viewing. Unoptimized PNG files from Adobe Fireworks are also notorious for this since they contain options to make the image editable in supported editors.</p>\n<p>Adobe&#8217;s Fireworks saves larger PNG files than many programs by default. This stems from the mechanics of its Save format: the images produced by Fireworks&#8217; save function include large, private chunks, containing complete layer and vector information. This allows further lossless editing.</p>\n<p>When saved with the Export option, Fireworks&#8217; PNGs are competitive with those produced by other image editors, but are no longer editable as anything but flattened bitmaps. Fireworks is unable to save size-optimized vector-editable PNGs. Poor compression increases the PNG file size but does not affect the image quality or compatibility of the file with other programs.</p>\n<p>When the color depth of a truecolor image is reduced to an 8-bit palette as in GIF , the resulting image data is typically much smaller. Conversely, some tools, when saving images as PNGs, automatically save them as truecolor, even if the original data use only 8-bit color, thus bloating the file unnecessarily. Before zopflipng was available, a good way in practice to perform a png optimization is to use a combination of 2 tools in sequence for optimal compression: one which optimizes filters and removes ancillary chunks , and one which optimizes DEFLATE.</p>\n<p>Although pngout offers both, only one type of filter can be specified in a single run, therefore it can be used with a wrapper tool or in combination with pngcrush , [note 2] acting as a re-deflater, like advdef. This often results in much smaller file sizes.</p>\n<p>For example, the following command line options achieve this with pngcrush:. Zopflipng offers 3 different adaptive method, including a brute-force search that attempts to optimize the filtering.</p>\n<p>The freeware command line version of pngout doesn&#8217;t offer this, but the commercial version, pngoutwin, does. By contrast, advdef from the same package doesn&#8217;t deal with PNG structure and acts only as a re-deflater, retaining any existing filter settings.</p>\n<p>Since icons intended for Windows Vista and later versions may contain PNG subimages, the optimizations can be applied to them as well. At least one icon editor , Pixelformer, is able to perform a special optimization pass while saving ICO files, thereby reducing their sizes.</p>\n<p>FileOptimizer mentioned above can also handle ICO files.

They never knew what WordPress was. My grandfather’s technical sophistication ended in turning on the screen of the desktop my father had purchased for him years ago. But as they crossed into their 90s, WordPress would come to be instrumental in their lives and mine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress found me in 2009. A good friend said I needed to learn this new thing that could “change our lives&#8221;. Their partner was using it as a Virtual Assistant…and she worked from home full time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technology interested me from an early age. I was inspired by the works of Aldous Huxley, the Beatniks, and Magick, as well as the science fiction of Isaac Asimov and Philip K. Dick. The moment I was able to install WordPress and create a functional website in five minutes without any coding knowledge, it felt like a whole new world had opened up and we now had the power to shape it how we wanted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That same week, I built my first WordPress site for someone else. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Like a friend who can&#8217;t help but show off their newest card trick, I was eager to demonstrate my &#8220;website-building skills&#8221; to all my friends and family. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It was through this process that I gained experience and began to appreciate the connection between our passions and having the ability to pursue them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also saw the websites as a canvas on which I could create art. My previous high water mark as a child was a slanted stick figure that when I showed my grandmother, the look of horror on her face even as she said, “what a wonderful artist!&#8221;, will always stick with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I continued to build WordPress sites in my free time for anyone who would take one from me but didn’t have the time, the resources, or the skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My career at the time was in Sports Medicine. This involved finding tools to manage training staff, athletes, and facilities. I came up against technology that we couldn’t afford or didn’t allow us the flexibility needed to control our businesses and our client’s health outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result in 2011, I began my first serious WordPress project when I was head of the training and rehabilitation departments for the Gold’s Gym locations in Seattle proper. The ownership group owned all seven facilities in the city. I worked out of the main gym in Kirkland, WA, where the executives who ran the Seattle tech companies, like Google and Amazon, would go back to after their office hours ended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As gyms seldom have tech departments, and ours were no different, I began learning WordPress as a serious designer, if not a developer, to solve problems we were encountering. The initial goal was to add training staff to the company website. That progressed into integrating SaaS products that would help our trainers track and share information with their clients. Finally, it involved switching over all the ownership group’s sites to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I put together a multi-site network (thank you WordPress 3.0 <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64c.png\" alt=\"🙌\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />) for all seven gyms that they could more easily manage and was more customizable while reducing their cost by $550 per location each month by abandoning the gym-specific website hosting previously used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything went off without a hitch, luckily for everyone! The staff and the membership all loved the new sites! </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The ease with which they could manage their memberships, book sessions, and keep engaged with the community when they weren’t at the gym were all huge positives for the business and the members.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Staff who trained clients were also ecstatic! The Kirkland Gold&#8217;s Gym is home to high-level athletes, such as professional MMA fighters, Olympic athletes, and bodybuilders. The ease of using WordPress to add users and manage our client’s progress increased the effectiveness of what we were doing and our ability to market our results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I took from that experience was the reinforcement of my belief that in an ever more connected world, WordPress, open source, and the ethos behind it all were a means to achieve almost any end. It was also a means achievable by anyone, regardless of class, gender, or skin color.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_c3be3c-51 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">My grandparents &#8211; Alice and Robert</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after in late 2011, I returned to my hometown in the state of Massachusetts. I went back to New England for various reasons, one of the largest was my grandparents&#8217; need for more physical support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent the next 6 years in Massachusetts. As my grandparent’s health continued to deteriorate, Alice&#8217;s from leukemia and Robert&#8217;s from dementia, I took jobs that paid less but allowed me more time to be there for them. I went from running a friend’s gym to running the training department, to being a trainer, to leaving sports medicine behind completely as the commitments didn’t work anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I worked various jobs for friends who knew my situation and offered as much leniency as they could. One friend owned McLaughlin’s gas station at the bottom of my grandparent’s street, which had a perfect view of their front yard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got paid less than minimum wage to sit, talk to people when they came in, pump gas, put air in tires, and be a buffer so the mechanics could get their work done. What I gave up in income, however, I more than made up for in the flexibility of the schedule.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>There was often a need for me to leave the gas station immediately after a rueful call from one of my grandparents. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The time between the phone call and unlocking their front after sprinting up the street was usually around 90 seconds or fewer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes the needs were comical to everyone involved! The most frequent was unlocking the cellar door to let someone out stuck downstairs. Sometimes, that was my grandfather, who had gone down and shut the door behind him. Usually, it was my grandmother. My grandfather would forget after a minute that she had gone into the cellar, and if he saw the door ajar while sneaking a cookie out of the cookie jar because my grandmother was away, he would close the door and then go back to his rocking chair in the other room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They began taking the phone with them everywhere they went in the house. Each time they would get locked in the basement I would hustle home, let them out, and we’d all have a good laugh about how ridiculous the world was!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything completely changed when my grandparents were in a car accident. My grandfather got confused driving about 50 feet back across the street, returning from taking my grandmother to the bank, as she could no longer walk there. They were both banged up in the crash, my grandmother severely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the rehab facility after discharge from the hospital the doctors determined my grandparents couldn&#8217;t go back to their home unless they had full-time care. Our family decided I would quit my gas station job and stay at the house with my grandfather until my grandmother returned, by then having put in place professional nursing services for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The week before my grandfather came home, I’d set up a WordPress website on Pressable hosting called &#8220;Unofficial Alan Moore&#8221;. I’ve been a fan of darker and offbeat comics and art since I could remember and have been supporting Alan Moore, and the global Arts Lab Project of Northampton, UK, for years via Kickstarter and fundraising efforts. I viewed my website as a great place to share the good people, fantastic art, and all these things that filled me with joy while I would be housebound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But support for my grandparents never came to fruition. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>When my grandmother returned and the bills increased, I turned to the only resource I could take advantage of at that moment, my WordPress website.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I changed the name of my fan site, Unofficial Alan Moore, to Emporium Purgatorio. This was a nod to Alan Moore’s and Kevin O’Neill’s eight-part series, Cinema Purgatorio. I installed WooCommerce, then opened an eBay store to gain traction and find inventory for my new business venture. I began purchasing rare and hard-to-find original comics and art at below-market rates. I would then resell or barter them, but instead of maximizing profits I maximized openness and honesty for the art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, coupled with my lifetime support and connections with the fantastic artists and writers still creating the works, led me to become the sole US distributor for many Indie projects coming out of the UK.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the next two years, I used only WordPress, WooCommerce, Pressable, and Jetpack, to go from my first $50 inventory purchase to selling single comic pages for thousands of dollars, the 2nd largest collection of rare Alan Moore comics in the world, and a global Arts Lab Community that is still thriving today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time must continue, though, and it did for my grandfather. After his passing I remained in the house to care for my grandmother. And I&#8217;ve never known as deep sorrow as the conversations she and I would have about regrets in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What still strikes me is that they were all about adventures not taken, not mistakes she had made. She encouraged me to follow my joy. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>When I told her I felt my joy would be to put a tent in a backpack and skateboard across the country, she said, &#8220;remember, Mark-Andrew, everything always works out when you&#8217;re doing things for the right reasons&#8221;. And I have remembered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Her passing is another singular story. This story ends with our house empty and me determined to remember what my grandmother said. It ends with a belief built on experience that with WordPress, and the community that continues to uplift it, we can make the world better…even if it&#8217;s just for one person.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_5e46ef-bf wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Epilogue</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I purchased an ultralight tent and quilt, paired what little belongings I had down to a 30L backpack that weighs 6 1/2 lb with everything I own in the world in it. I made one last stop at my local skate shop, where I&#8217;d been going for 30 years, to say goodbye and pick up my new skateboard setup.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_20190529_144811-scaled.jpg\"><img /></a>The last of my worldly goods.\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_20190603_171431.jpg\"><img /></a>Everything I owned.\n\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next morning, the familiar creak of the front door as I locked it one last time almost overwhelmed me. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>But I took a few deep breaths, put the keys in the mailbox for the realtor, and pushed away down the street towards the west coast 3,300 miles away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That was years ago now. I&#8217;ve been building WordPress websites and hosting them for good humans at no cost, using just my mobile phone, ever since. *Yes, absolutely zero. I don&#8217;t charge for my time, I don&#8217;t charge for hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the skateboard is always in my hand or under my feet, and most of the community that knows me by name are skateboarders themselves, what’s allowed me to continue to push wherever I wanted to go, whenever I wanted to go, is WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t know the number of lives I may have affected. Most of those I’ve built sites for or supported, I don’t know where they are today. Almost all moved on as their businesses and their ideas grew. They take over the work themselves, or hire teams, for what comes next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do know every single person I&#8217;ve introduced to WordPress has told me they wish they had known about this sooner. They were better off after being introduced to WordPress, and what’s possible when you take control of your own destiny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t keep track of pretty much anything in life, except the people in front of me and any project I&#8217;m undertaking at that moment. I&#8217;ve forgotten most of the places I&#8217;ve been, and most of the things I&#8217;ve seen. But I feel that is as it should be. I feel fulfilled and ecstatic almost every moment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the thing that continues to allow me to just let go, to just be what I feel is my most authentic self, is WordPress. So, thank you. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2764.png\" alt=\"❤\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/alice-robert-and-wordpress/\">Alice, Robert, and WordPress</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 16:00:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"Mark-Andrew Nordstrom\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WordCamp Central: Thanks to Automattic for sponsoring community events worldwide\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/?p=3161241\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2023/02/thanks-to-automattic-for-sponsoring-community-events-worldwide/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2766:\"<p>We couldn’t be happier to welcome <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://automattic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic</a>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/sponsor-multiple-wordcamps/\">WordPress global community sponsorship program</a>&nbsp;in 2023!

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, making your WordPress websites personal to each visitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice, or go to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the show, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you all your idea featured. Head over to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Paul Halfpenny. Paul is the CTO at Filter, a remote first digital agency that specializes in open source tech, such as WordPress, Laravel, React, React Native and Ionic, with enterprise clients. He&#8217;s been a speaker at WordCamp Europe and has an interest in making websites a more personal experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website personalization is the idea of amending content served by your website to match the conditions of your current users. It might be that you want to show, or hide, content to people during certain times of the year. Perhaps it would be helpful to translate content if the user comes from a specific locale. Or maybe you would like to offer a product based upon pages that a user has previously visited, or items that they have bought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this falls under the umbrella of personalization. And it&#8217;s an area that Paul thinks is going to be more important in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast, we talk about what techniques you can use to offer up personalized content. That could be WordPress plugins or options within blocks, but there&#8217;s also more complex setups with a whole range of &#8216;at the edge&#8217; technologies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chat about what kind of information you might want to amend on your website and whether it&#8217;s possible to do too much, and risk users feeling that they&#8217;re being tracked wherever they go online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can website owners and users benefit from these techniques, and can this be sold as a service to clients in the same way that you might offer SEO or website optimization?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, we talk about whether or not aspects of personalization should be added into WordPress Core. Have SaaS services, which bake this into their platforms, heralded in an era in which personalization is expected by the majority of clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an interesting chat with many insights and tips. And so if you&#8217;re looking to explore this further, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more. You can find all of the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll find all of the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Paul Halfpenny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Paul Halfpenny. Hello Paul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] Paul Halfpenny: Hello, how are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:05] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. Good. Thank you. Very nice to have you on the podcast today. Paul&#8217;s going to be talking to us about personalization in WordPress, which is a topic, at least on this podcast, we have never touched upon. So this will be a really interesting and novel episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we begin Paul, every episode I get the guests just to give us a bit of orientation, tell us who they are, where they work, how long they&#8217;ve been working with WordPress, and all of those kind of things. So, although it&#8217;s a very generic question, can we begin there? Tell us about yourself Paul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:33] Paul Halfpenny: I&#8217;m Paul. I&#8217;m the CTO at Filter. We&#8217;re a remote first digital agency. We&#8217;re based in the UK, and we specialize in open source tech such as WordPress, Laravel, React, React Native. We&#8217;ve been working on WordPress since about 2012. We&#8217;ve done that for a number of different clients that we&#8217;ve worked with over that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some small, some large, some we&#8217;re not really even allowed to mention. And we&#8217;re a WordPress VIP partner agency. We&#8217;re an Altis partner agency, WooCommerce partner agency as well. My co-founder and I, Ollie set up Filter just to try and be a little bit different to normal agencies. So we try and ensure that we have regular hours during the week, so nine til five thirty. We try not to work evenings and weekends, wherever possible. We are family friendly, so we try and be as flexible as possible with everybody in hope that we create a nice environment for everybody to work in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:31] Nathan Wrigley: Oh, really nice. Thank you very much for telling us all that. That&#8217;s great. The subject for today is personalization. Now, in the real world, we probably have a great understanding of what that means. We like things to be personalized. But we may not understand what it means in the context of websites and WordPress websites in particular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So do you mind just spending a few minutes broadly, give us the 10,000 mile high overview of what you mean by personalization in websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:59] Paul Halfpenny: Yeah, so I think personalization is the process of knowing what the needs and preferences and interests of your customers or your site visitors are. So you can serve them what they&#8217;re looking for. So that&#8217;s going to allow you to give them more relevant communications. That&#8217;s going to perhaps improve their experience of going onto a website or an app that you develop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s about creating that kind of smart content for your audience. So you are going to use items such as perhaps their location, their demographics, maybe what device they&#8217;re using, maybe where they&#8217;ve come from, maybe the language that they speak, to show them content that&#8217;s relevant to them. So for instance, if you are running a promotion on Facebook, and you&#8217;re directing people to your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might want to show visitors from that campaign an offer that you don&#8217;t send to anybody else. So you might check where they&#8217;ve come from, check the referrer, and then you might show some content on the website that gives them a promotional code that they can use in your shop, for instance. So it&#8217;s really about ensuring that you are trying to ensure that each of your users has an experience that&#8217;s relevant and contextual to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:19] Nathan Wrigley: I guess it&#8217;s a fairly new idea, and by that I don&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s within the last year or so, but it&#8217;s not something that is as old as the hills in terms of web technology. You know, if you go back a decade or more, this was possibly beginning with some of the bigger platforms. I imagine Google were making forays into trying to figure out what your search results should look like. But in terms of WordPress websites, this feels like the beginning of that journey. Am I right in that or has this been going on for a while?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:51] Paul Halfpenny: So personalization, I think, at an enterprise level has been around for a while. The really obvious answer is Amazon. So Amazon has been tracking your user behavior on their site, and they know which products to show you. So particularly in e-commerce, it&#8217;s a really big focus. And I think over the last decade, I would say, that&#8217;s translated itself into being, not just something that&#8217;s in custom platforms that bigger companies develop for themselves, but in proprietary content management systems like Sitecore or Optimizely, which have personalization baked into their core, and allow site editors to manage that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we have only really seen it become of interest and becoming more popular in WordPress over the last couple of years. Yeah, it&#8217;s kind of more recent in WordPress, but it&#8217;s been around for a while. And I think even if I think back to my first agency job, which was in around 2003, I think 2002, we were talking to people that were selling email personalization. They would send a trigger campaign and then based on a response they would send out another type of campaign. So personalization is just becoming more standardized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:06] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you. That&#8217;s really interesting context. There&#8217;s a couple of words that you use there, which I think might be worth drilling down into. The first one was, well, you may have said no or knowing, but you said something along the lines of, knowing more about the user, but also you then, a little bit later possibly, substituted that word for tracking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the two are very different, I guess. And in the example that you used of Amazon, I&#8217;m guessing the majority of what they know is based upon you being logged into their platform and performing actions. So, as an example, I&#8217;ve logged in and I demonstrate a desire to buy, I don&#8217;t know, a trampoline, and all of a sudden that&#8217;s bound to my account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas it could be also trying to discover things when nobody is logged in. It&#8217;s just a visitor to the website. So you mentioned geography. So I&#8217;m coming, I&#8217;ve got an IP address, which appears to come from France say, and that can serve up different kind of content. So I guess it&#8217;s interesting to get into that conversation about is there a difference between knowing and tracking, and also the state, whether we&#8217;re logged in or not logged in. Whether any of that is important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:17] Paul Halfpenny: Obviously, when you are logged in, you get a lot more information about that user. So you can tie it to a particular user profile. You can match it to what they did last time they came back to the site. If they&#8217;re not logged in, you can only track them as long as a cookie might be stored in their browser, for instance, and if they clear their browser cookies you&#8217;re not going to be able to remember or retain that information for the future. So logging in gives you certain benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We try and split it down into simple and complex personalization. So simple is the idea that you just show basic content to nudge them in the right direction. So you might be using their location. To say okay, you&#8217;re coming from France, I&#8217;m going to show you this particular content. Or you might understand where they&#8217;re coming from and you don&#8217;t require them to be logged in to give them that level of personalization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a really good example of simple personalization is the ability to use date-based controls to show somebody different opening times during a holiday period. So, for instance, you might want to show a different block of content to somebody on the 20th of December that shows them when you are open for Christmas, and then you want to remove that block and you are just using simple controls to be able to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more complex type of personalization is where you are actually tracking that data. And there&#8217;s a couple of ways to do that. So, you can obviously get people to log in and you can score their behavior on your website. So that might be when somebody goes to a particular page, you might decide to attribute a particular value to that page. So if they go to the homepage, you might give them a one, and if they go to the sales page, you might give them a five. And then if you go to a pricing page, you might give them another couple of points as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in the background you can then associate some rules and go, well, if they hit this particular score, we are going to show them a particular piece of content. So you are tracking them around the website and you are understanding what they&#8217;re doing. And obviously you&#8217;ve got your user data there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s all using what we call first party data. So first party data is the data that you take on your site that your customers have agreed to give to you. I think in the wider industry, there&#8217;s a, particularly at the enterprise level, there&#8217;s a lot of large companies using platforms called CDPs, and that acronym stands for customer data platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And customer data platforms are a way of ingesting content from lots of different third party sources. So you might bring in data from Facebook and you might bring in data from AdWords, and you might bring in data from email, for instance, if you&#8217;ve got an email database. And the customer data platform will allow you to stitch all of that data together to provide more 360 holistic view of what you are doing across the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s looking at all these data points and it&#8217;s matching you across all these different accounts. And then based on that, you can take different decisions in marketing automation to personalize an omni channel campaign where you are perhaps tracking what they&#8217;re doing on Facebook and then showing them something else on the website based on what you know they&#8217;ve done on Facebook previously. That sounds a little bit scary. That&#8217;s the kind of world that we are living in right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:33] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I guess elements of it could sound scary, couldn&#8217;t they, depending on how far you take it and where the data ends up. But in the scenario that we may get in depth in today, if everything is just holed up in WordPress, I guess that&#8217;s maybe a different discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m interested to know how you would implement this, because a lot of the things that you described there, on the face of it, seem fairly complicated. It also seems that there is no limit to how complicated you could make it. So you could have condition, upon condition, upon condition. You really could go down the rabbit hole. So my first question is, is there a sort of seesaw here? Is there a, you have to weigh up what the benefit is as against the time it takes to put all these things together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I&#8217;m sure as developers of websites, we&#8217;ve all been down that rabbit hole before. You put a ton of time into something which it turns out was absolutely pointless. Nobody looked at it or nobody interacted with it in the way that you were imagining. And so there&#8217;s that trade off. But also what kind of interface are we dealing with here? I&#8217;m guessing this is the domain of plugins. How do we build these, kind of, if then statements to make all of this happen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:42] Paul Halfpenny: The idea that it&#8217;s quite complicated is true. So it can become as complex as you allow it to really. I think over the past decade or so, what we&#8217;ve seen is that when people have bought enterprise content management systems that have personalization tools baked in. They haven&#8217;t actually been able to get the full value out of those tools in all situations. Because they would very often need to bring in a team or fund a team to allow you to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that can take multiple years, if you have complex requirements. And it costs a lot of money to do that. I think WordPress is a great example of going at it a different way. So within WordPress, there&#8217;s a number of different plugins out there that allow you to add personalization to your website very simply and easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a lot of those are also leveraging the benefits of Gutenberg as well. So, one that I&#8217;d really like to pick out is Block Visibility by Nick Diego, who&#8217;s a, I think is still a developer advocate at WP Engine. And that&#8217;s a, that&#8217;s a great plugin for being able to decide whether to show or hide block of content based on some custom rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s others out there. IfSo&#8217;s quite a popular plugin that allows you to do that as well. But it also allows you to create audience segments and add conditional CSS where you need to. There&#8217;s plugins such as LogicHop. That has a pretty comprehensive rule set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Human Made, as part of their Altis platform, they&#8217;ve been building something called Experience Blocks more for the enterprise set, I would say. Where they are taking that data offsite and then allowing you to use pretty enterprise analytics to see, to do AB testing and to personalize content as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also ways to do it at the hosting platforms as well. So we call this personalization at the edge. So rather than putting a plugin into your site, which might slow your site down, or you might have too many complex rules, hosts such as Pantheon and WP Engine have options to allow you to vary the content that&#8217;s being sent back from the CDN or the cache layer. So it doesn&#8217;t actually hit your WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Pantheon, have a PHP library that allows you to do that. WP Engine allow you to segment your user content using a vary response header. So you can say, well, for this group of users, I&#8217;m going to segment this group of users, this type of user, and then show them this content. But it doesn&#8217;t actually hit WordPress. It&#8217;s a cached version of that page that hits that particular segment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:16] Nathan Wrigley: It sounds from what you&#8217;re saying that the WordPress plugin route, so you mentioned Block Visibility, Logic Hop. You also mentioned IfSo, and there&#8217;s probably some others. It sounds like they maybe are the domain for people who are just sort of dabbling in this. They might not be experienced, they might not be developers, but it sounds like when you go to the edge scenario, the WP Engines and Pantheons and what have you, you really need to be an expert at this or at least be committed to becoming an expert in it. Is that a fair appraisal or have I misunderstood?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:49] Paul Halfpenny: I think that&#8217;s relatively fair. I think certainly doing it at the edge is probably slightly harder. I think the benefits of doing it with a plugin such as the ones that we mentioned, allow you a more point and click interface within WordPress itself, within the WordPress admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And actually they&#8217;re as comprehensive, if not more comprehensive than other methods. I think the important thing is, is ensuring that they&#8217;re associated with Gutenberg or Elementor, and you can do that within those page builders as well, or block builders or whatever we&#8217;re calling them these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that it&#8217;s a relatively smooth and easy process for people to use. I think for me, the key is always about ease of use. So, when we look at the kind of CMSs that we&#8217;ve used over the past 10 and 20 years, I know that the best reaction we get from our clients is when we show them WordPress as a contact management system. Because it will be, oh, thank goodness, that seems easy to use. I can cope with that. I don&#8217;t really have the time to go on a five day course to learn how to use this CMS, because I&#8217;m not using it every day. I&#8217;m using it once a week to post some content. And so WordPress really works for that, which is why we, you know, that is our CMS of choice these days, because we know how well it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think Gutenberg&#8217;s a massive step forward with that as well in terms of having a WYSIWYG editor, having the ability to drag and drop blocks onto the screen. And I know things aren&#8217;t absolutely a hundred percent perfect right now, and I know there&#8217;s still challenges, and I know there&#8217;s still things to improve upon. But actually that&#8217;s a great interface for clients and the best personalization tools allow you to quickly and easily decide which blocks to show on a screen to which particular users?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:37] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, in terms of performance of a website, that is something which is more and more, especially from the Google side of things. It feels like Google are really making performance and speed and all of the metrics that they&#8217;ve got for how quickly page loads and all of that. That&#8217;s very important and obviously any website that wants to do well needs to be found in a search engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m wondering if the WordPress plugin route is going to make that more difficult. So as an example, if we get really carried away and on our homepage of our website we have multiple different areas of personalization. It&#8217;s three days to Christmas and so we&#8217;ve put different images all over the webpage. We&#8217;re telling people that oh, hi, welcome visitor from France, or whatever it may be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get the picture, we&#8217;re just adding in all of this stuff. And every single time we add in something, we&#8217;re adding complexity. And although the example I&#8217;ve given is ridiculous. Still, I&#8217;m sure that certain queries, certain things that you are asking are going to have an impact. So we&#8217;ll just speak about that for a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:42] Paul Halfpenny: Valid question. So I think it&#8217;s really important to remember that not every WordPress site runs like on a blazing fast hosting platform, and can cope with complex queries. A lot of WordPress sites run on shared platforms, they run with limited resources. And if you do add too much complexity to what you are trying to achieve, it might impact on your site speed. And obviously as you add that complexity and you add WordPress to be doing more, particularly in the database on every single request that you&#8217;re sending it back, that prevents it from being cached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we did some work on this in terms of personalization, we built our own plugin, WP-DXP. We actually used a web component on the front end that communicates with the backend via the REST API, and that returns the data in some json. So it&#8217;s a lighter touch way of being able to add that personalization into the page, without having as much impact on the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think it&#8217;s really important, I think there&#8217;s a limit to how much personalization you should put in place. So we&#8217;ve talked quite a lot internally about how we can use AI to personalize websites. The jury&#8217;s kind of still out on that actually, because we are not sure that you need the ability to show absolutely different content to absolutely every different visitor that&#8217;s coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, what you should be doing is just chopping up your users into different types of audience segments, and then basing it on that. And you perhaps don&#8217;t need more than a couple of audience segments for a simple site. I think if you are doing something really complex and actually you really need high levels of personalization, then it might be that you&#8217;re running a headless site anyway, and you&#8217;re using APIs to deliver the content rather than sending it back to the server and doing it that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:36] Nathan Wrigley: I guess like anything else, if you have an infinite amount of resources to throw at it, that could be time, development cost, or indeed just money on infrastructure to actually host the site. More or less all of this is going to be in purview, but the more meager your resources are, probably the lighter a touch you should have with all of this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:56] Paul Halfpenny: Yeah, and I think, if you&#8217;re just running a personal site or you are running a brochureware site for maybe a shop or a restaurant or a bricks and mortar store of some kind. You probably won&#8217;t have high level needs for personalization. You might have the example that I talked about earlier in that you want to show different opening hours. So you might use a date based request, or you might want to show a promotion to certain kinds of people at certain times of year. But you probably won&#8217;t be using scoring across the site to understand their behavior as they go around your website. That&#8217;s probably not an issue for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas if you&#8217;re running a publishing site, and you are developing news or content on a regular basis, then you might well need to do that. But then you&#8217;d expect that your resources will be higher and you will be able to have a dedicated server or a different kind of hosting platform that allows you some more resources to do that, to implement that complexity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:50] Nathan Wrigley: I guess your imagination is the limit really here, isn&#8217;t it? You could do whatever you like. And I think examples like social media platforms, you may have an opinion about whether these are good for society or not, but social media platforms are examples of serving up personalized content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My Facebook feed is nothing like yours. The same would be true for when I go to Twitter. It&#8217;s giving me content based upon a whole slew of data that it&#8217;s got. And it&#8217;s really compelling. I come back and I come back and I come back and even sometimes I tell myself I shouldn&#8217;t come back. I keep coming back. And it really is the personal touch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you can find aspects of that. Now, I imagine very few people are actually trying to build a social network. But just the idea that you could serve up something and learn over time that that one little thing is impactful. The position of something, the color of something, where it is on the page or whatever it may be. It&#8217;s definitely worth exploring because we know we are influenced by these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:53] Paul Halfpenny: I always come at it as a, we want to help users to find the answers. So that&#8217;s where personalization works for us. It&#8217;s trying to recognize who they are, what their interests are, where they&#8217;re coming from. Nobody&#8217;s on the same journey. Everybody will land on your website on a different page. And it&#8217;s about trying to work out, if they haven&#8217;t logged in, who are they? Or if they have logged in, you know who they are. Perhaps you&#8217;ve got a little bit of history about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then trying to provide them with the answer that they need so they can carry on with their day. What people don&#8217;t want to do is come to a website and click around for ages, trying to find the information that they want and then get disappointed and go away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, we should be trying to ensure that people get the information that they need as quickly as possible and have a satisfying experience. It&#8217;s almost the same as for an e-commerce shop. What you want to do is, you know you probably want to buy this thing, you want to get there, you want to find that item, you want to purchase it as quickly as possible, and then you want to carry on with your day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody wants to sit on the internet all day trying to find information. I do think you&#8217;re right about the depths of personalization that social media have gone to, and how there is a danger there of. perhaps unintentional bias. So obviously when you&#8217;re personalizing at that level and that scale, you&#8217;re putting everything into machine learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;re taking what people have done on the site before. You&#8217;re sticking that in some kind of data lake or big platform on the backend. And then you&#8217;re using machine learning to look for patterns so you can go, right, okay, next time this happens, show this to this person, because a hundred people, other people did this as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you end up having those biases and potentially putting people into echo chambers that mean that they don&#8217;t see the outliers. They kind of get trapped, in seeing the same information, and that&#8217;s not really helpful. I always talk about my Apple music station. I have Paul Halfpenny station on Apple Music and for some reason, well, it brings up a lot of Depeche Mode to begin with. And that&#8217;s a good thing for me, but it very often brings up a specific Manic Street Preachers track, and I love the Manic Street Preachers, more they&#8217;re early stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But because this track keeps on playing, I assume it thinks that I really like that track. And then it keeps on playing it to me again. I&#8217;m kind of stuck in that cul-de-sac around that track right now. I think trying to use personalization to help people find answers is not necessarily to put them into a specific hole and go right, we know this is who you are, this is exactly what you want. It&#8217;s creating some openness, allowing them to see answers that they might not be expecting sometimes, not always providing everything to what they&#8217;ve done before, is where we should be heading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:32] Nathan Wrigley: it sounds analogous to me, going to the supermarket with my shopping list and more or less entering a shopping experience where on the first aisle is everything I want. I have to walk 10 meters into the shop, and my trolley&#8217;s now full, my list of shopping items has been ticked off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I&#8217;ve just achieved what I want to do, and then I walk out the shop and get on with my day. So it&#8217;s a bit more like that. It&#8217;s trying to put things which are more helpful. I agree that the AI thing is something which, I don&#8217;t think at least WordPress and personalization, were probably not quite there yet, certainly not on the scale of the major social networks. But yeah, just the idea of going into a supermarket. Having the list, but somehow being presented with a supermarket, which is just what I want. That does seem like a really laudable target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:23] Paul Halfpenny: Yeah, Yeah I love the fact that you used a shopping list. I&#8217;m very strange, I think because I enjoy going to supermarkets. Slightly weird, whenever we visit another country, I like to go in the supermarket, and we were in America recently, and going to Walmart was probably the highlight of my trip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to go and look around, but then, you know, I also like to be able to go to Sainsburys and go and get the three items that I need and get out of there pretty quickly so I can get back home for tea. So knowing where everything is, is really helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:51] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, okay. I&#8217;m going to change my analogy in that case. So I walk into the supermarket and when I get to the toothpaste bit, there is only toothpaste, but there&#8217;s multiple brands of toothpaste. So it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s only giving me one toothpaste, but it&#8217;s just sort of showing me, well, here&#8217;s all the toothpaste for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s really interesting. I&#8217;ve experienced this in real time, in that I&#8217;ve been contacted by some developers who&#8217;ve demonstrated what their plugin can do. And I have to say it really caught me short. I was a bit blown away by what the page was showing me. It wasn&#8217;t scary. It was quite entertaining and engaging, and I guess you just have to draw a line for yourself. How much work do you want to put into it? How much weirdness do you want to put into it? And by that I mean, how much stuff are you going to show back to the user, which makes them check themselves and say, hang on a minute, how do they know I&#8217;m in France? That&#8217;s weird. Those kind of things. I guess you&#8217;ve just got to figure that piece of the jigsaw out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:44] Paul Halfpenny: I think there&#8217;s something there for everyone. That&#8217;s the really important point. Personalization&#8217;s not just for enterprise. It&#8217;s not just for your Amazons. It is for your small sites, it is for your medium size sites, and it is for your enterprise sites as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just the complexity grows as your business grows. But I think that there is something there for everybody. You could name any kind of business and you would probably be able to go, well actually, why don&#8217;t you personalize in this way for that kind of person? Or, you&#8217;re coming from here, you would show them a different message. It&#8217;s really useful to think in those terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:19] Nathan Wrigley: In the same way that 15 years ago there was no SEO career, there was if you worked at Google, but if you were an SEO trying to figure out how to best present your web property, that career probably didn&#8217;t really exist, and now it does. I&#8217;m wondering if personalization might well go in the same direction, you know, if you were to become an expert at this, knowledge of all the different plugins, knowledge of all the different platforms, if it&#8217;s a career path that you could possibly develop? Because it is quite a specialist skill, and especially when you described the Cloudflare and the Pantheons and the edge cases for all of that. If the technical barrier is so big that people may want this, but they also haven&#8217;t got the time to implement it, and so they would purchase in that skill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:06] Paul Halfpenny: Yeah, I think there is an opportunity there to do that. I think people don&#8217;t always see the return on investment. Perhaps they struggle to go, well, actually, if I make this change, what was my ROI to do that, and therefore what&#8217;s the cost benefit analysis of doing it? But if you look at most big companies right now, they&#8217;ll all have a CRM team or a digital team that is focused on this type of activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you go to any e-commerce provider or website online, there are people whose job it is to improve conversion, that&#8217;s what they do. And personalization is a part of improving conversion. And it takes in a couple of different skillsets. So there is a skillset, certainly massively around UX. So what&#8217;s the user experience? As a user, if I come to this website, what do I expect to see? Where do I expect my users to go after they&#8217;ve landed on this page? And am I trying to get them to go and do this? Or am I trying to get them to go and do that? Can I show them this kind of content?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do I know about them that I can then provide them with some additional value whilst they&#8217;re on this website? Or how can I remove friction so that they can complete their journey more quickly? And there&#8217;s some design that&#8217;s required for how you might do that. So UI interface design. Analytics. So analytics is really important to understand what people are doing, where they&#8217;re tapping, what they&#8217;re clicking on, and what they&#8217;re doing on that site and what their life cycle is as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then putting the content in and making sure that the content is relevant and contextual for that particular situation. So just editing content on a site for different audiences might mean that you need to create different variations of that content that may be worded slightly differently as well. Whether that&#8217;s multilingual content, maybe it&#8217;s a different way of talking to a different type of customer. We all know that you&#8217;re probably not going to speak the same way to maybe a marketing manager that&#8217;s coming to your website, as you would do to a developer that&#8217;s coming to look for a job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:06] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. You mentioned ROI and what have you, and I wondered if a lot of that is built into these technologies, so, for example, in the case of the WordPress plugins, either yours or one of the other ones, whether you have that data inside of WordPress, or do you need to go and hook it up to other tools, some analytics tool or what have you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, a simple AB test, can that be done in these platforms? And does it give you a, well 15 people clicked on the blue variation, but 28 clicked on the red variation. Do you get any of that feedback in here? Or are the WordPress tools simply a case of, look, here&#8217;s the technology to do it. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve got for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:45] Paul Halfpenny: So some of the plugins offer those stats and can record it in your own database. And others will do it offsite. So I think Logic Hop is part of this AB testing. I might be wrong. will score your AB testing, on your own site. But I know that Altis uses enterprise analytics that will then it will determine what your potential size of your audience is for a particular segment so that you can apply some rules to that segment? It depends what you are trying to achieve. If you are just trying to show people, so you can do it in a couple different ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can obviously store the data in your own WordPress instance. Most people will probably use Google Analytics or Fathom Analytics, to understand where people might be tapping on buttons and maybe put an event in via Google Tag Manager so that it can register that tap or that click when the content is shown to them. That would be a really good way of doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, we come back to the problem that smaller sites are on, potentially on, shared hosting. They might have the resources. And if you are storing stats up in your database, how useful is that and how many resources you are using and is that slowing your site down?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:57] Nathan Wrigley: One final question just before we knock it on the head is, in terms of the availability for this in WordPress. At the minute, it&#8217;s very much the domain of plugins. So plugins in the traditional sense of the word, but also you&#8217;ve got things that work with the block editor as well. But my understanding is, forgive me if I&#8217;ve got this incorrect, my understanding is that you would like to see aspects of this creeping into WordPress Core?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if that&#8217;s true, I think it&#8217;s fair to say that you have a, an impression that most people, or a significant proportion users of WordPress would find this thing useful. It would be a great tool to have in. And you point to the fact that the commercial rivals, so Optimizely and Sitecore and so on, they have this built in as part of their core platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to just speak about that for a minute? Have I misrepresented you there, or would you like to see some of these tools, and I&#8217;m guessing you&#8217;re not imagining the full monty? Just a subset of simple things built into WordPress Core?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:00] Paul Halfpenny: I really do think it needs to be in Core. I use WordPress in a couple different ways. I use it for my personal site, for myself and my friends or other small companies that we just do pro bono work for. I use it in my agency life. So we work with mid-market and enterprise companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I&#8217;ve seen how WordPress compares to other content management systems on the market. And I think as WordPress grows, I think this is a feature that kind of needs to be in there and that would be useful to most users. I see value in it from a, a number of different ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even something as simple as having the ability to show content or hide a block in Gutenberg based on if somebody&#8217;s logged in or not. That for me would be really useful, based on the device type they&#8217;re using, based on where they&#8217;re, what country they&#8217;re coming from. I don&#8217;t think it needs to be to the extent of putting AB testing in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think all of that kind of functionality can be done via plugins to extend it. I think there&#8217;s adequate scope there if somebody wants to do more, that they could add some plugins to do that. But I do think as WordPress grows and changes over the next decade, I think that personalized user experience becomes even more important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it&#8217;s better for users for WordPress if this stuff is handled and managed and added to Core, so that it&#8217;s there for everybody to use as they need it. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s terribly complex in terms of being able to create some rules to show some content or be able to show or hide a block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think there&#8217;s also something around working in enterprise that shows us that that is really needed for WordPress to compete as an enterprise platform. And I&#8217;m really aware that not everybody that&#8217;s listening to this or, you know, the majority of people that work with WordPress don&#8217;t work with Enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s, it is not really relevant to them. But I think that that&#8217;s just what we see in the market and we see WordPress being adopted by enterprise. And it&#8217;s one of the things that clients ask us for. They ask us for loads of things. They say, have you got multilingual baked in? No, you need a plugin for that. And there&#8217;s a couple different ways to do that, but it&#8217;s coming in Gutenberg at some point in the future. And they go, well, have you got workflows? No, haven&#8217;t really got workflows. Has it got its own analytics system? Well, no, it hasn&#8217;t got its own analytic system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then personalization is one of those other big features. So, we are interested in it because we work with WordPress. We like to be able to use WordPress in those situations rather than having to deliver on other platforms, which perhaps we don&#8217;t enjoy working with as much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, we know clients don&#8217;t enjoy working with them as much. And actually we think there should be a really great alternative to those platforms. It is a personal view, you know, but I think that there&#8217;s a growing demand for it. And I think that with Gutenberg and the move to block based content, it becomes a lot easier. It wasn&#8217;t really possible in the old classic editor approach. You know, you could do it on the front end, but it&#8217;s very code heavy. But now it&#8217;s relatively simple to achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:24] Nathan Wrigley: Paul, if somebody listening to this podcast shares your opinion there and wants to reach out and get in touch and continue this discussion, where would be the best place to do that? It&#8217;s up to you. It could be a Twitter handle or an email or whatever you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:39] Paul Halfpenny: Is anybody still on Twitter these days? I do wonder, like I scroll my Twitter feed now and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be as many people on there. Look, I would love people to get in touch because I just love talking about this stuff, right? So I think it&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the opinions are really interesting. filteragency.com is our agency website. paulhalfpenny.com is my personal website. You can email me, paul @ filteragency.com. You can find me on Twitter, with a terrible photo that makes me look much younger than I actually am, paulfhalfpenny, I think. To be honest, there aren&#8217;t too many Paul Halfpenny&#8217;s around, so, you know, typing it into Google tends to give some results. It&#8217;s quite fortunate, really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:22] Nathan Wrigley: Paul Halfpenny. Thank you very much for chatting to me on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:27] Paul Halfpenny: Thank you very much. It&#8217;s a pleasure to be invited on.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulfhalfpenny\">Paul Halfpenny</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paul is the CTO at <a href=\"https://filter.agency/\">Filter</a>, a remote-first digital agency that specialises in open-source tech such as WordPress, Laravel, React, React Native and Ionic with enterprise clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s been a speaker at WordCamp Europe and has an interest in making websites a more personal experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website personalisation is the idea of amending content served by your website to match the conditions of your current users. It might be that you want to show (or hide) content to people during certain times of the year. Perhaps it would be helpful to translate content if the user comes from a specific locale. Or maybe you would like to offer a product based upon pages that a user had previously visited, or items that they have bought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this falls under the umbrella of personalisation, and it’s an area that Paul thinks is going to be more important in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast we talk about what techniques you can use to offer up personalised content. That could be WordPress plugins or options within blocks, but there are also more complex setups with a whole range of ‘at the edge’ technologies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We chat about what kind of information you might want to amend on your website, and whether it’s possible to do too much, and risk users feeling that they’re being tracked wherever they go online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can website owners and users benefit from these techniques, and can this be sold as a service to clients in the same way that you might offer SEO or website optimisation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, we talk about whether or not aspects of personalisation should be added into WordPress Core. Have SaaS services which bake this into their platforms heralded in an era in which personalisation is expected by the majority of clients?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an interesting chat with many insights and tips, and so if you’re looking to explore this subject further, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://filter.agency/\">Filter agency website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpvip.com/partners/\">WordPress VIP partners</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sitecore.com/\">Sitecore</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.optimizely.com/\">Optimizely</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-visibility/\">Block Visibility plugin by Nick Diego</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.if-so.com/\">If So plugin website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://logichop.com/\">Logic Hop website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.altis-dxp.com/accelerate/experience-blocks/\">Experience Blocks website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dxp/\">WP-DXP plugin</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tagmanager.google.com/\">Google Tag Manager</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://usefathom.com/\">Fathom Analytics</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulfhalfpenny\">Paul&#8217;s Twitter account</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 11:45:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"Post Status: WordPress 6.2 Beta 2 • Help Test • Theme Directory Redesign • Apply for Community Summit\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=147279\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-6-2-beta-2-help-test-theme-directory-redesign-apply-for-community-summit/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14830:\"<h2 id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-february-6-2023\">This Week at WordPress.org (February 6, 2023)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">WordPress 6.2 Beta 2 is now available.

Organizers and participants will be using the #WP20 hashtag on social media to designate posts as related to the event.

WordPress 5.9 <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/52065\">fixed a performance regression</a> where WordPress’ default of lazy loading all images was causing slower performance on the Largest Contentful Paint metric (LCP) metric. This resulted in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-9-to-fix-lazy-loading-performance-regression-resulting-in-30-faster-page-loads-in-some-cases\">30% faster page loads in some cases</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Four months ago, it was discovered that block themes were having an issue with lazy loading where the previous fix was not working as expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With the introduction of block themes, that logic was not functioning correctly, resulting in all featured images to be lazy-loaded, regardless of whether it was the LCP image or not,&#8221; Arntz said in the commit message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Together with an update to the <code>core/post-featured-image</code> block included in <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/55079\">[55079]</a>, this changeset fixes the logic to correctly handle featured images in block themes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Additionally, in combination with an update to the <code>core/template-part</code> block from <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/55246\">[55246]</a>, this changeset includes an enhancement which uses the benefits of block template parts to avoid lazy-loading images in the <code>header</code> block template part, making the lazy-loading heuristics even more accurate for sites using a block theme.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/55318\">fix</a>, which is included in the 6.2 Beta 2 release, introduces enhanced logic to determine the LCP image in block themes and avoid lazy-loading it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Provided everything stays on track, the official release is now just six weeks away, targeted for March 28, 2023.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 22:20:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WordCamp Central: GoDaddy joins the WordPress global community sponsorship program in 2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/?p=3161230\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:115:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2023/02/godaddy-joins-the-wordpress-global-community-sponsorship-program-in-2023/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3410:\"<p>Please join us in welcoming <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/pro?utm_source=wcglobal_2023_sponsorship&utm_medium=events&utm_campaign=en-us_events_prg_awa_partners_part_wcsponsordesc_001\">GoDaddy</a>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/sponsor-multiple-wordcamps/\">2023 WordPress global community sponsorship program</a>!

Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of episodes ago, I mentioned the Community Summit in the small list of big things. That&#8217;s coming up on August 22nd and 23rd, right before WordCamp US. And for some of you, that made complete sense, and the only thought in your mind was, wow, our last one was in 2017, how could so many years have passed since then? And since so many years have passed, today we&#8217;re gonna talk a bit about the Community Summit, what it is, where it came from, and why it&#8217;s so important for the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:09]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>First things first, let&#8217;s talk about what exactly the Community Summit is. The Community Summit is a small event where folks from around the WordPress project and community come together to work through some of the most difficult topics the project currently faces, many of which are easier or at least less fraught when we can be face-to-face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Community Summit is usually done in an “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference\">unconference</a>” style, and when we were smaller, we left topic gathering and voting to the day of. That&#8217;s evolved a bit as our group of fearless contributors has grown over the years, and this year, we have been asking for topics ahead of time so that we can make sure we have the right folks in the room and are making the best use of everyone&#8217;s limited time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to take a look at this event and think it&#8217;s like some fun exclusive thing with a who&#8217;s who of WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I assure you it&#8217;s a working event. Decisions are not finalized during the event, but since we try very hard to account for many, many viewpoints, it ends up being two days of hard discussions, contentious viewpoints, and problem definition at a level of complexity you don&#8217;t really see every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hearing how hard this event is, you may be wondering why we put in that effort. There are a lot of reasons, but there are three that come to my mind immediately. So for starters, working across cultures is hard. Apart from the cultural differences, we tend to be aware of things like where we&#8217;re located or our lived experiences, things like that– working remotely or distributedly is a whole different set of skills than working in person. This helps remind everyone that we&#8217;re humans, that there are humans behind those comments and behind those messages in Slack. The second thing is that I&#8217;m a big supporter of Tuckman&#8217;s theory of group development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t know what that is, you can look for it, we&#8217;ll put a link in the show notes, but it&#8217;s that forming, storming, norming, performing kind of concept of how groups come together. Because there are so many of us and our community has such a large footprint, there are little storms a-brewin all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some get really big, some stay small. But at some point, most of them have to be addressed. And this is a space that is specifically designed to help us do that. Which brings us to the third reason that we do it. This event uses something called the Chatham House Rule, which creates a kind of temporal psychological safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. Psychological safety, if you&#8217;re a leader, you know that that&#8217;s something that is built over time and requires a lot of trust and a lot of conversations with people that you&#8217;re working with, and we can&#8217;t quite do that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so Chatham House Rule builds an environment that helps create that suddenly in the moment and requires, you know, some, some faith in one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But basically, no one can be quoted about what they said in those conversations. No one&#8217;s examples can be attributed to them. But the conversations can be summarized and published, which we do on the Community Summit website. And then, we publish those for our collective knowledge over time. This lets folks who are attending advocate for themselves and others fully without worrying over whether they&#8217;re gonna be taken out of context later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, one of the biggest questions we get ahead of any Community Summit is why it is by invitation only. The most commonly cited reasons for keeping this small and invite only have everything to do with logistics and leadership. You want it to be large enough to have good representation but small enough to have high-quality interactions. It&#8217;s just a really narrow Goldilocks moment, if you will.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:00]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that reason doesn&#8217;t necessarily address the need for invitations rather than letting it be first come, first served. The reason for that is more of a philosophical one and requires you to go on a mini historical journey with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also has changed a bit over the years. The first ever Community Summit, way back in 2012, was before my time, but if I recall my history correctly, it was truly by invitation only. The summit after that included a closed nomination process. The next included a team nomination process, and then the last two, 2017 and 2023, have included open nominations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, even in the nomination era of Community Summit organizing, there is still a selection process. The organizers review the list of suggested attendees and check for the same types of things we expect major WordCamp organizers to look for in their speaker selection.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:00]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things like which teams they contribute to, what communities they advocate for, and how long they&#8217;ve been a member of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then they adjust for balance. In addition to those things, there are also four types of voices that we always want represented at our Community Summit. So first is leading voices, people who are already in the community and kind of are helping us to make decisions. I am considered one of those leading voices; I have put in my application to be included in the Community Summit. Really hope we select me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one is future leading voices. Specifically, those are people who are active in the community already and are showing a lot of promise, either because they really understand the values that the WordPress open source project is putting forward or understand the basic processes of communicating and guiding people in such a complex ecosystem as the WordPress project represents. Or because they have said quite plainly they are interested in helping us to make sure that the WordPress project is able to move and continue to create and continue to support democratizing publishing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:00]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a little bit potentially folks who are self-selecting for that. People who already are showing that they are doing that either in WordPress or in their local communities. That&#8217;s one of the types of voices we want to include. A third one that we want to include all the time is voices we need, so voices that we need to hear. People that specifically we are building WordPress for, people that have indicated to us that the CMS is not necessarily perfect for some of the use cases that they run into regularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the people and users and community organizers that can and are able to advocate for the types of user interactions, the types of community interactions that we absolutely want to be able to see.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s a third group of voices that we want to make sure we have represented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the fourth and final group that we always want to have represented is a group that I call voices we miss. And so those are the people that we want to be able to hear more from in our project that we don&#8217;t necessarily either have a good group of representative voices for, so it&#8217;s hard to hear them, or that we know are probably users of the CMS or they are attending events, they are somehow involved in the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we don&#8217;t necessarily have any way to have accounted for them while we were building solutions way back in 2012 or 2006 when things were being built for us. And so those are the four groups of people, the four types of voices that I absolutely want to have represented at our Community Summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:00]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I ask organizers to go through this incredibly complicated selection process because we want not simply a microcosm of the WordPress community as we see it today and hope to see it in the future but also an equitably voiced forum during that critical problem definition phase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So TLDL. For, listen?! T L D Real Listen. Although if you didn&#8217;t make it through that, you definitely are not getting to this point. So a TLDR for folks who skimmed the transcript and got here, I guess we keep this invitation structure because we want to account for voices we don&#8217;t hear every day in the WordPress project. Not because we don&#8217;t value them but because we already hear them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now that brings us to our small list of big things. This week it&#8217;s actually kind of a big list of big things, but you know, there it is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>First things first. The applications for the Community Summit are now open. Those are the applications to attend. It&#8217;s pretty short. I filled mine out this morning and it&#8217;s three questions about who you are and your username on wordpress.org, and then three questions about the topics you are most interested in and the experience that you have in those conversations so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. It took me, like, I think, 90 seconds. Like, a full minute and a half. So head on over there. We have a link in the show notes, but also, you&#8217;ll be able to find it in newsletters across the entire WordPress media ecosystem. I am pretty sure about that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that there is a proposal out for a project-wide mentorship program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a huge potential win for us. It is aiming to fix some of our broken ladders. If you&#8217;re not familiar with my Broken Ladder Theory of the WordPress project, I&#8217;ll try to remember to find a link to that post and put that in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number three is that Openverse moved. I shared this last week that happened last week. They didn&#8217;t move very far, though. They have a new URL, you can find them at openverse.org. It&#8217;s the same team. It&#8217;s the same product. It&#8217;s the same group of excellent openly-licensed images and media that you have come to expect. It just has its own standalone URL now. Huge kudos to the contributors who got that done.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing that happened last week is that WordPress 6.2 has moved into its beta phase, and so now is the time to get out there and test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There also was an excellent, excellent write-up about how to test any given release. And I think it also includes how to file a good bug. And so we&#8217;ll send all of those things into the show notes. They&#8217;ll be easy to find. Get out there and do your testing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And number five, longest, small list of big things in recent history.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got some interest on [a] women, and non-binary led release for 2023, and so since there was some interest shown for that, it is hereby verbally confirmed. Keep an eye out on make.wordpress.org for more information about what that process is gonna look like and how to volunteer your time for that if that is something that calls to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woo. And that, my friends, is your small list of big things, your big list of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 17:01:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Santana Inniss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WordCamp Central: Thanks to Weglot for supporting the global WordPress community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/?p=3161226\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2023/02/weglot-supports-the-global-wordpress-community/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1793:\"<p>Many thanks to&nbsp;Weglot&nbsp;for their support of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/sponsor-multiple-wordcamps/\">WordPress global community sponsorship program</a>&nbsp;at the Gold level!

The Openverse library of openly licensed and public domain works has also moved to <a href=\"https://openverse.org/\">its own website</a> with an updated design. It contains more than 600 million free-to-use images and audio files that are now available inside WordPress&#8217; editor:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking on an Openverse image will instantly insert it as an Image block with the proper attribution and license automatically added to the caption. The experience is so much faster than downloading from the Openverse website and then uploading to the Media Library.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.stocksnap.io/img-thumbs/960w/Y8CKB0O8C2.jpg\" alt=\"\" />&#8220;<a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/stars-galaxy-Y8CKB0O8C2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stars Galaxy</a>&#8221; by <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/author/17101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Greg Rakozy</a>/ <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/?ref=openverse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CC0 1.0</a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"ticss-9da20087\">Another major highlight in 15.1 is the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/46571\">add custom CSS on a per-block basis</a>. This can be done through the Global Styles menu in the Site Editor. For each block you can add your own CSS to customize the block appearance by scrolling to the bottom of the panel to the &#8220;Additional Block CSS&#8221; button. These CSS edits will be applied to all instances of the block on the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 15.1 also introduces <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/46502\">support for shadow presets</a> in Global Styles, with four defaults available (Natural, Crisp, Sharp, and Softy), and the ability for theme authors to add custom presets via ‘theme.json’.  The announcement post included a video that demonstrates the new UI:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In 15.1 Navigation has been added to the browse mode sidebar in the Site Editor, so users can quickly access their menus and menu items, rearrange them via drag and drop, or navigate the links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release makes some <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/47430\">changes to the &#8220;paste styles&#8221; feature</a> that was introduced in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-15-0-introduces-sticky-position-block-support-adds-paste-styles-option\">version 15.0</a>. The Options menu in the block toolbar now displays both &#8220;Copy styles&#8221; and &#8220;Paste Styles&#8221; to make it easier to understand how to use the feature, as it previously was unclear with just the &#8220;Copy Styles&#8221; option available.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 15.2 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/47182\">improves the Site Editor loading state</a> for better initialization. This is an important update for making the Site Editor ready to come out of Beta. It&#8217;s not a complete solution but makes it a bit more polished with the following changes, as outlined by Riad Benguella in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/47182\">PR</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A CanvasSpinner that can be used in components that have a &#8220;ready&#8221; state. So instead of rendering an empty white page, the spinner is rendered when these components are not ready.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Makes sure the iframe has a &#8220;white&#8221; background by default to avoids too much background color switches during initialization.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just a few of the highlights.

With such a large ecosystem of products, finding a secret niche spot to develop your product isn’t always the best or even attainable solution. Doing something better than the next company is sometimes all it takes for great success.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The David and Goliath Struggle. </strong>It’s obvious that there has always been and will continue to be an unbalanced level of success between independent WordPress product owners and large companies. But that’s not to say there isn’t room for everyone; there is. An independent startup can move much faster into achieving short-term goals and growth than large-scale established companies can with a heavier workload and slower forward movement.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Valuing Community Over All Else. </strong>The WordPress community is what drives the future of WordPress. It’s not so much all the great new things the system offers but the people behind the process. Taking that same thought into your business, making people the center of your solutions, is an undeniable way to create a business that is surrounded by community.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Removing Language Barriers. </strong>Creating website language translation is becoming more of a priority. It ties in with the need for developing a better user experience for your customers. Your community needs a specialized way to interact with your products and site. That’s one main task Vova’s team is tackling for their customers this year</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"is-layout-flex wp-container-10 wp-block-columns sponsor has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\" id=\"StellarWP\">\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-column\">\n<h3 class=\"StellarWP has-theme-palette-1-color has-text-color\" id=\"Sponsor\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <span><a href=\"https://poststat.us/elementor\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\">Elementor</a></span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elementor </strong>enables web creators to build professional, pixel-perfect websites with an intuitive visual builder.

Welcome back to another Post Status draft episode. And this is, uh, another interview and story in our agency journey series. Um, I&#8217;ve got Brad, who&#8217;s been a member of Post Status for a long time that leads, uh, Allie Interactive. Um, but we&#8217;re gonna. Talk about his story in just a little bit. But, um, you know, I&#8217;m always interested in these stories because how you got there, where you were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we&#8217;re gonna talk a little bit about WordPress in the future. And, um, but Brad, thanks again for, um, being, taking some time to share your story and journey. Could you tell us a little bit about yourself and your, your origin story with WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> Yeah. Thanks Corey. Thank you for, for having me on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah, I started with WordPress around about, I wanna say 2008, 2009. Uh, I spent, I spent my entire career [00:01:00] working in publishing technology up to this point, and, uh, I started at. Forbes Magazine, uh, in right around 2001. Uh, I eventually worked for forbes.com and, you know, towards the, the end of my tenure there, we were getting into launching some blogs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, I thought this WordPress platform looked pretty cool. Uh, I believe version three had just come out and, and, and it was starting to look, you know, a little more. Enterprise technology. Uh, you know, up to that point, you know, I think Droople was probably even Jula, I hate to say, was, was, uh, you know, an, an early, uh, adopter in the early, had some early adoption in the enterprise market, but WordPress was really picking up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I liked the, I liked the technology behind it. I liked the interface a lot better than either of those platforms and, you know, just really on my own, took over a, a spare server and started to build out some blogs. Um, I, I had finally left the company in, in [00:02:00] 2010, but, Shortly after I left, WordPress actually took over, you know, their entire c m s at least for, for a period of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, it, it was good to see, um, WordPress start to get some, some enterprise adoption, uh, in that, in that market. Um, you know, and, and still at that phase, you know, WordPress was still. You know, I, I would say more uncommon than common, you know, for, for usage and enterprise publishing. You know, fast forward to, um, you know, 2010, I, I had taken over as CTO of a, of a small media company and we had a need to build out a couple of foreign language sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, we had actually chosen Droople at that time, uh, not WordPress and. My COO at the time, um, had previously worked at the New York Observer, um, with a couple of folks, uh, Austin Smith and, and Matt Johnson, uh, who had just founded a, a very small [00:03:00] agency, uh, of three people called Ali. And, uh, I, I became acquainted with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, hired them to build, build those two sites for us. So I actually became one of Ali&#8217;s first clients, uh, before I even worked here, uh, which, which was pretty cool. Um, stayed in touch with them. Uh, and then, uh, 2012 when I was, uh, c t o of a, a small startup, um, which, Wasn&#8217;t, wasn&#8217;t the best job I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say, uh, I won&#8217;t name the company. Um, but Ali was just starting to really, um, grow at that time. Uh, they were about to land, uh, their first set of really big enterprise clients, uh, a couple of which we still work with to this day. They&#8217;re also getting more into WordPress because, you know, the, the market really seemed to be starting to head in that direction, at least for open source enterprise publishing technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had built up a lot of WordPress knowledge at the startup that I was working at. You know, we had, we had stayed in touch over the, the last couple of [00:04:00] years and. Uh, I, I decided to join them and there were, I think, six of us at that point. And, you know, later, um, you know, shortly thereafter became, uh, the, the third partner in the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve added a, uh, several others since, but, uh, you know, we&#8217;ve grown to a team of 70 people since then. So there&#8217;s a lot that happened in between. But, you know, it, it was an interesting journey to, to get to, you know, where I am today. Um, you know, as CEO of the. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. Well, you kinda shared some of that snippet of your journey related to Allie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, what does Allie do in WordPress in the world? Like who, who are your kind of focused clients? Um, what are the kind of types of work you do related to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> Yeah. When, when Austin and Matt, you know, originally founded the company, um, what was great is that you. I think the three of us always shared a common vision for, for what we wanted it to [00:05:00] be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and, and really a common interest in, in the types of clients that we wanna work with. You know, the. The worldview that the company was, was founded with wa was with the, the First Amendment as the, the company&#8217;s North Star. Uh, you know, a strong belief in freedom of the press, um, and, and really helping, you know, it sounds very bold, the helping civilization bridge the divide from, you know, pre to post internet free speech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so the, the partners in the agency have always staunchly supported publishing and, and as a result, you know, we have only ever worked with publishers. Uh, you know, we started with. A lot of expertise in, specifically in news media. Um, you know, Austin and Matt had experience working for companies like the New York Observer, um, New York Times Slate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I, I had worked at Forbes and a couple other media companies, so, you know, we, we had a lot of experience there, but, You know, it, [00:06:00] it became clear that there were, you know, others who really fit that, that definition as publishers that were also important and interesting for us to work with. So, you know, early on, one of our first big clients was, was the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and since then we&#8217;ve worked with a lot of other nonprofit publishers, you know, who have, you know, just as an, an important mission supporting their communities as our news media clients do supporting free. Um, you know, and we&#8217;ve worked with some book publishers and, and cultural institutions as well, but, you know, allie&#8217;s like never gonna build an an eCommerce site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re, you know, not gonna get into, you know, other areas of, of, you know, WordPress development and design. Uh, it, it&#8217;s always been focused on publishers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> That&#8217;s cool, especially with your background, uh, in publishing. Um, Forbes, obviously everybody knows Forbes. Um, and one of the strengths I&#8217;ve seen of WordPress, obviously it&#8217;s democratized publishing, so that that lines, and I love the, [00:07:00] the focus on the First Amendment, and the free speech part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s excellent. So with a lot of these publishers as being kind of a default client of what you all focus. Um, what&#8217;s the type of work, can you, and, and I know there&#8217;s clients you might not be able to talk about, so I, I totally respect that, but what&#8217;s the type of work you&#8217;re doing for some of these clients?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it rebuilds, is it park maintenance? Is it responding to a news team or a room or something like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> Yeah. You know, and, and I think that that&#8217;s part of the, You know, evolution of the company that I sort of glossed over between about 2012 and now. Um, when, when I started you, you know, Allie originally, um, the folks that started it myself and, and, uh, and Austin and Matt and, you know, we, we, everyone that started the company and was there in the early days were, we&#8217;re all developers and, you know, we all had experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, as programmers, you know, I wrote code for. [00:08:00] Pretty much until about five years ago, um, you know, full-time. Uh, and you know, so that&#8217;s where we started. You know, we partnered with, uh, large organizations to build out, you know, solid publishing technology, infrastructure, you know, with the caveat that we understood publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had. Worked with folks in newsrooms. So, you know, although at that time we weren&#8217;t doing actual, like web design, we understood how to design a CMS that was efficient and, and that took the experience of the editors, you know, into account. Because, you know, very often, you know, I, I, I saw it in my, in my own career for many years, folks would build things for, you know, for editors to use, folks who.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often on a deadline trying to get a story out quickly. And the interface would be clunky, it would be slow, it would be inefficient, you know, too many clicks, too many steps, not intuitive. Um, so that part of what [00:09:00] we do was there from the beginning. Um, but early on we were working with, you know, primarily outside designers to, to actually, you know, create the designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had a couple of agencies that we used to partner with, you know, relatively frequently. It became clear to us like round about 2014, uh, that, that, that was a pretty inefficient way to work. And, and so about eight, no, now, now nine years ago, we started our own design practice internally and, and now really, you know, we, we&#8217;ve become truly a, a full service agency from strategy to design to, to development it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just so much more, much more of an efficient experience for the folks that we work with to have, you know, A single team under one roof that has all the skills end to end to, you know, thoughtfully think through what we should be building for them. Because, you know, we&#8217;re not just implementing code and design and products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re helping to transform their business. You know, like especially on for r and D&#8217;s media [00:10:00] clients, you know, creating. A product that generates sustainable revenue for them is very important. Um, and, and the only way that we could do that effectively was to bring everything under, under one roof. Um, . You know, one of the other things that we always saw, you know, in, in working with an outside design firm is you always had this, this dreaded handoff, you know, of, of the design from one agency, um, to the other, you know, to us for implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, back then it was, you know, Photoshop files. Eventually it became, Envision and then Figma. Um, but, you know, regardless, you know, developers who weren&#8217;t necessarily in the room when the product was being conceived are now being forced to interpret it. And certainly, um, you know, especially once, you know, responsive design became a thing, you know, we all, we all take it for granted now, but.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, not every breakpoint situation, you know, potential flow of text around embeds and images was, was thought about. And a [00:11:00] lot&#8217;s left up to interpretation. But, you know, by having developers and designers on a single team, you know, we are able to do a lot more design and browser. You know, we can create a Desi, uh, a style guide and immediately go to code and, and we know that the product works earlier on and, and it really saves our clients a lot of time and money and hassle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, really we&#8217;re not, we don&#8217;t wanna waste people&#8217;s time, you know, doing things that can be done in a better way. If we wanna spend our time, most of our time, you know, thoughtfully thinking through, you know, what is the best product that we can build for them that&#8217;s gonna meet their goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, I asked the question cuz I know, um, you all recently posted a job on post status for, I think it was senior WordPress developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m curious what a senior WordPress developer at Alley, you know, does like, what&#8217;s their week or day look like? You know, coming in, working with these, like, I, I was just going to your website and I was like, New York Post National Science [00:12:00] Foundation, um, of course the Kaiser Foundation and. That&#8217;s exciting to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m, my background is as being a journalist, but I, these are name brand, very well known, huge organizations doing really good work in the world. And I wor and I wonder like, how does that connect down to that WordPress developer at Ali doing work on like a weekly basis because, um, I come from the product side and always, you know, some people prefer the product side, but there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s a potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monotony. Okay. I&#8217;m just doing these things with client work and some of these clients, I&#8217;m like, oh, there&#8217;s gotta be something new pushing the envelope every day. Uh, publishing is changing, web is changing, and all that. So what does a, a typical week in a WordPress developer&#8217;s life look like at Ali?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> Yeah, it, it, it&#8217;s certainly, I mean, it&#8217;s certainly interesting, you know, for for sure, you know, every, every team has, uh, [00:13:00] typically a, a mix of one or more clients that they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re supporting and in the long term, you know, we.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really value having long-term relationship with, with our clients now, I would say the, the vast majority of work that we do after we build something, we end up, you know, working with that client for months or years afterwards. I think our longest client relationship is probably hitting 11 years this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, which is, which, which is pretty crazy to me. It&#8217;s, um, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a long time. All, all of our teams, uh, in general are, are dedicated Scrum teams that work with, you know, a client or a particular, you know, set of clients. Uh, so our, our developers. You know, tend to say working on, on the same teams, you know, month over month, even, you know, even year over year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and, you know, they are working with, uh, you know, a product manager, a scrub master, um, you know, a designer if, if they&#8217;re working on a team that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s in the midst of a design [00:14:00] project. So, you know, they are, they&#8217;re part of a team that&#8217;s that&#8217;s trying to. You know, come up with Yeah. Ongoing solutions for, you know, whatever business problems our, our clients are trying to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and yeah, in the case of something like the New York Post, you know, where, which you mentioned, um, it&#8217;s not even just implementing product, you know, that&#8217;s really interesting work for, um, the developers working on that project because we&#8217;re. Often pushing the bounds of, of WordPress and WordPress, VIP and, and you know, what those particular platforms can do to serve WordPress at scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re talking about, you know, hundreds of millions of people that are, that are trying to access a WordPress site. Um, you know, which is pretty amazing when you try to, when you think about where. You know, WordPress came from, its, its origin 20 years ago. Um, you know, the sites we built are probably serving collectively billions of page views a month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, so, you know, WordPress has really, you know, hit that, hit that true enterprise scale. Um, [00:15:00] which is probably something more we can, we can, we can talk about later. Um, but yeah, the, the average developer that you know is, is working at Ali is, is solving, uh, Really interesting, complex problems. Um, but also they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re serving Ali&#8217;s mission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re supporting publishers, you know, they&#8217;re not just, um, writing code for the sake of writing code. They&#8217;re writing code that&#8217;s helping, you know, keep the world informed or, or helping communities, uh, you know, beyond, you know, what they&#8217;re doing. You know, just, just day to day working at Ali.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Any, any way you&#8217;re able to combine making meaning. With money, profits and perfect, uh, purpose. I, I love that. And serving that, hiring good with, while getting paid, you know, to do and solve problems every day. So. Okay. I&#8217;m curious, you have an extensive background with publishing and this is a little bit off my normal scope, but I want to go where, where you know people are [00:16:00] and get your feedback and vision and thoughts publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I go back to the actual print. I remember my first job. I was like in awe, seeing this big printing press, you know, go around and something came out the other side and then, um, I would drive home and by the time I got home that paper would be on my doorstep. Internet revolution, all that revolutionized all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;ve seen so much with publishing. I&#8217;m curious, you know, the web just continues to acceler. With and, and technology accelerates. What are you seeing with publishing? How has that evolved in your, you know, in your career? What are you seeing in the future for it? We&#8217;ve got, like I just saw medium. Um, embraced Macedon, which we&#8217;ve talked about on this podcast, uh, the fed averse and all that. And, you know, again, the, the headline is another billionaire buys a [00:17:00] big social network, and, but I&#8217;ve seen this trend. I love publishing, I love publishing with WordPress. I, I just wanna ask the general question. What are you seeing now? What are you seeing in the future for publishing on the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I, gosh, like this, this could be an entire podcast episode, but it, it should be, you know, . What, what I will say is that when I started working full-time in publishing, um, you know, 20 years ago and, and I had been. You know, aware of the publishing technology world. Prior to that, my, I actually got into this business because my, my uncle actually helped design the first, uh, electronic publishing system at Time Magazine in the seventies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s really like comical to me to look at the, I have, I solved the Frame Blueprint, um, believe it or not, . Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> That&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> It had, it had a massive array of two, 300 megabyte hard drives that, that [00:18:00] pub powered the entire system. Anyway, what What was comical to me about it was that they were all dumb terminals that ran off a central server, and then we went into this whole desktop publishing revolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone had this whole end-to-end suite of. You know, very complicated, expensive applications, um, on their desktop computers. And now we&#8217;re doing everything in web browsers, connecting to a server. So we actually had it figured out like 50 years ago, and then we kind of straight away for, from a bit, and then we came back to it, which is, which is amusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but, you know, the, the, the bigger, the bigger thing to me about the transition from. Print to web and, and where we are today is, you know, like 20 years ago when I was first getting into this and we were starting to, you know, really see, um, uh, proliferation of publishers, you know, launching more, you know, full featured websites that, you know, weren&#8217;t just, you know, a few articles thrown up here and there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like they might have been in the late ni in the [00:19:00] mid to late nineties for the very early adopters. And they were, they were full-fledged products with unique content of their own. But I think that a lot of publishers, and, and I have some, some stories that I, that I can&#8217;t share, but I, but I know certainly details about how certain publishers thought about things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but there was a prevailing sentiment that the websites then were an experiment, you know, or, or even, uh, you know, a toy, they, they. Viewed as being necessarily, you know, the, a real publication, the way that the, the newspaper or the magazine or whatever it is, was, um, so they were free and, and we set this, this expectation very early on that websites were, were free. You would just go and read them and, you know, there were a few that had a paywall, but, um, you know, charging for content online back then was also super hard [00:20:00] because the payment technology stunk. Um, people, you know, weren&#8217;t. Quite used to, to buying things online yet like they are now, you know, eBay, Amazon sure they existed, but it&#8217;s not like it is today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, the, the payment systems that were available, you know, had a fair degree of friction to them. Um, you didn&#8217;t necessarily have the consumer market for it. The, the publishers themselves, especially, you know, folks like at the, at the C-suite level, didn&#8217;t really view them as being a primary business driver yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, you know, then, then of course things changed. Everything moved online. Um, you know, throughout the mid two thousands, you know, we just started to shovel ads onto the sites and we were getting loads of traffic and making tons of money for advertisers. And then, you know, advertisers started to get savvy about things like viewability and click through rates, and it&#8217;s like, oh wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, real human beings probably aren&#8217;t seeing about 80 or 90% of these [00:21:00] ads. And then, You know, that whole market just cratered and you know, so now you&#8217;re left with this dilemma where most of the traffic to your publication is now online. People want to consume content that way, and it gets hard to start to shift the mindset that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, to, to that you should be paying for this content. Um, and, you know, you can still make money on advertising, but it takes a tremendous amount of volume. Um, or it takes an extremely niche market. Um, you know, for example, Um, you know, a site like the Points Guy Travel site, you know, they make a ton of money on, on, on credit card referrals, which are really high, um, you know, high value things that, that, that, that those companies are going to pay for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, you know, those examples are few and far between and you&#8217;re, and you&#8217;re left with this, you know, this middle ground where. You know, publishers aren&#8217;t getting the subscription revenue from the websites that they need to get. They&#8217;re not getting the ad [00:22:00] revenue they need to get, and they&#8217;re having dwindling print subscriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so, you know, how do all of these important organizations that are keeping the world informed, you know, continue to exist? And, and that&#8217;s an ongoing challenge that, you know, we are trying. To help our clients work through. And, and there&#8217;s really no, you know, one size fits all solution for, for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, during the, during 2020, during, in 2021, during the pandemic, when. Us, like a lot of folks had a, had a little downturn in business, we had some availability. Um, you know, that&#8217;s why we started working on our lead platform, um, L E D E for all you publishing nerds out there. Um, and you know, that was specifically geared towards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Startup, subscription driven publications, you know, to help create the next generation of, of sustainable journalism. You know, everyone on the platform, you know, has, has paywall content. They charge a subscription fee. [00:23:00] Um, and, and we&#8217;re helping them, you know, build out those communities to, to, you know, create, you know, really the next generation of publishers because without things like that, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s really hard for them to get off the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You. If you have funding for a startup publication, you, it&#8217;s probably pretty limited, and you shouldn&#8217;t be spending it on technology. You should be spending it on hiring writers and, and, and, you know, enabling those people to go out and, and, and do their jobs and, you know, you know, create great content. So, um, it just, you know, anyway, it&#8217;s a challenge, but, but I think that we all really screwed up back in the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, in the early two thousands when, you know, we didn&#8217;t set the expectation that, you know, you have to pay for this. Did you pay for your newspaper before that? Did you pay for your magazine? Of course you did. . Yep. You know, maybe you&#8217;d, maybe you&#8217;d read it for free if you had found it on the train or you were sitting at the dentist&#8217;s office, but you know, if you wanted that, that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content for yourself in the comfort of your own home. You paid your [00:24:00] subscription fee. So yeah. Um, there, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a big reset that&#8217;s going on now and, and, and, you know, and you know, uh, we want to be here to help our clients, you know, think through that, work through that, and, and, you know, use our experience to, you know, hopefully guide them in the right direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, there&#8217;s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> too many outlets. I think quite a bit about that, that seem to have. A big transition. This is why I got outta the newspaper. So it&#8217;s like they weren&#8217;t embracing technology. It&#8217;s like you said, they set a wrong expectation from the beginning. It&#8217;s like, how do you preserve that? And the two I think of are Washington Post in the New York Times, the, the Gray lady, I think she&#8217;s still called, um, iconic journalist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, organizations, um, and I see the New York I, I&#8217;ve watched The New York Times, obviously I use Word all every day, but I go, you know, it seems like they had some good traction with digital subscriptions and, and things like that. And so I love that cuz [00:25:00] there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s such a part of this fourth estate that it, that we need as a society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quality journalism, sharing, like you said, inform the world of what&#8217;s going on. Uh, and it&#8217;s sad because I&#8217;ve seen what used to be local. Like, the newspapers I worked for were local, city based, you know, small compared to the one we just talked about. And, um, there&#8217;s a vital need that they played in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now contrast that too. So what do you think? Are you seeing trends and things? Obviously you, I, I looked up lead here and I love the name by the way. Um, lead. So trying to help them build community. So that&#8217;s another part of some of the things we&#8217;re seeing in publishing. It&#8217;s not just inform. It&#8217;s, I mean, post status is a very microcosm of this is like, we do news, I guess we do content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but really we&#8217;re a community. Um, and, and I&#8217;ve seen that with business, how we&#8217;ve added community into business. We did this at I [00:26:00] themes, uh, now with post status is going okay. I don&#8217;t, we get labeled as a news outlet, but I go, we&#8217;re we&#8217;re community, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re relational. Um, what are some of those things you&#8217;re seeing with, uh, within the publishing organizations you all work with?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building that community. You see, uh, authors and writers building their own community, like Twitter instantly goes, okay, you can&#8217;t see ESPN or any of the big things. You see the little, here&#8217;s the anchor or writer or whatever it is talking, and there&#8217;s a Twitter byline. They&#8217;ve cultivated their own kind of followings and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what are you seeing with those kind of trends related to lead, uh, lead in the work that you all do with your clients?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong>  Yeah, with on, on Leads specifically, you know, I obviously, you know, you could, you know, from an economic standpoint, you could gauge the success of the community through the number of subscriptions they get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, obviously if people wanna pay you money, they wanna be part of, you know, what, what you have going on. But, um, one of, one of the most interesting things I see [00:27:00] within, within Lead is with, with Defector, which is probably the, you know, one of the largest sites we run on the platform, and you know, how.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How many websites do you go to that actually have a decent comment section under their articles? Um, you know, not, not many. Uh, you know, in fact, some of our clients have started to only selectively enable comments or disable them entirely because there just wasn&#8217;t productive. . And you know, pretty much every defector article that that gets written has dozens of comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, not only do the people wanna read the articles, they wanna discuss them with each other, with the other folks that are, that are reading the site. And they&#8217;re actually like, really funny and interesting, you know, like arguments and comments and, and um, you know, discussions around the topics at hand that go back and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, to me, I would gauge that as being a success over, over anything else. I, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m part of that community as well. I mean, I&#8217;m probably a little biased. I was a big fan of Deadspin, [00:28:00] um, back in the day. But, you know, I think what you said, Um, before when you were introducing, that was also really interesting, which is the, the, the topic of local news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think local news is, is been affected by this shift. You know, more than anyone, you know, if the Washington Post and the New York Times, you know, decide to start, you know, charging a subscription fee, which of course they both did, you know, um, many years ago. Yeah, with their scale, it&#8217;s easier to maintain some degree of profitability and they have profits coming from, from other areas as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not just their, their online subscription revenue, um, you know, cuz they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re catering to a national audience. The New York Times is, and the, and the Washington Post are. New York City and Washington DC papers in, in name only, you know, they, they certainly have a, both have a metro beat, which, which covers the local area, but the majority of the content appears to a national, even a global audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re just dealing with a different scale. Um, [00:29:00] you know, there are so many local news deserts that have developed over the last decade across the country where, Um, you know, the local paper is just gone, or, you know, there were three local papers, even in major metropolitan areas. Now there&#8217;s one local paper, um, and, and you don&#8217;t have any, you know, dissenting opinions and you don&#8217;t have enough coverage to, to reach every community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and that news is just disappearing, you know? No, no one&#8217;s covering it. Um, you know, with, with folks. Buying print subscriptions with, you know, not even having the scale to, to, to generate any online revenue. Um, you know, it&#8217;s really hard. So they end up getting. A lot of them that do still exist end up getting, you know, slurped up by one of the, the major conglomerates that&#8217;s purchasing lots of local news organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and even then you, you, you&#8217;re seeing their operations get gutted in favor of centralizing, you know, copy editing and, and, and lots of other services. [00:30:00] So, , you know, the actual folks that are on the ground covering things are really limited and, you know, there are stories that are slipping through the cracks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I mean, I mean, look at, look at, I live in New York City, right? I mean, and, and the New York City metropolitan area is a huge market. We have multiple papers. And you know, something like the George Santos story, which was definitely covered by a local media organization, you know, slips through the cracks to the point where, you know, someone was elected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stevie had lied about some things, . So it, it&#8217;s really just, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s quite remarkable that even in a, even in a market like, you know, New York City, um, something like that can happen these days. So, um, you know, I think we, we really, we, we have a lot of questions we have to answer and I, and I don&#8217;t have all of them today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah. You know, but certainly it, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a goal of mine to help, you know, help help us, help our client organizations work, work through these challenges. Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So thank you for that. Cause I just wanna get perspectives, um, cuz this is, the [00:31:00] publishing is central to WordPress and, you know, switching, uh, uh, an area here for a second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just wanna get your quick thoughts on this and then we&#8217;ll move on to WordPress on the enterprise, but, You know, my story with WordPress is I started my first WordPress blog in 2006, not really to anything I&#8217;m doing today, but it, it enabled me, empowered me to be able to publish and that that was an incredible experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking publish on my first WordPress site. and there&#8217;s this trend that I see and I go, yeah, we called them bloggers back then, but the creator economy, and I&#8217;m just kinda, I know this isn&#8217;t your bread and butter, but it is in a bigger category that you all serve at a high, high level. Um, but the creator economy, the ability to someone to go on an Instagram, create content, engage a kind of followers slash community, and I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>opportunity with WordPress two. Um, my wife looks at Instagram quite a bit. That&#8217;s kind of [00:32:00] her default entertainment channel. And one day she was like, just look. Cuz I was like, ah, I don&#8217;t have time. I, I don&#8217;t want to get, I&#8217;ll go down that rabbit patrol. But I started looking at some of the people that created content and go, they&#8217;ve got massive followings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you go business model creator economy. And I think WordPress is positioned there to go, how do you monetize it? Same problem we have on the big scale publishers. We talked about how do we find a sustain. Business model for that classic journalism, local news, news in general, but then for the creator economy, I&#8217;m curious your thoughts on that, what you&#8217;re seeing, what you hope for, uh, in that, I ha have the ability now to create or press blog or Twitter account or a Instagram or whatever that is, and become a de facto one person publishing company and myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What, what are you seeing for that? Do you pay attention to that? What are you curious about seeing</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> for. Yeah, and there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a lot there. Um, you know, for, for WordPress itself, [00:33:00] you know, you, you essentially have, you know, two creator economies. You have those that are creating the software and those that are creating the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s actually a, you know, a, a a really a double pronged creator economy, um, within the WordPress world itself. You know, for, for something like. You know, TikTok or Instagram or, or you know, Twitter, um, you know, as probably less so, you know, Twitter to a degree. Cuz I feel like, you know, primarily folks are, you know, following people that they&#8217;ve chosen to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and if they&#8217;re getting exposed to other accounts, it&#8217;s usually through retweets, you know, um, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a little less algorithmic than I would say, you know, especially TikTok, which is entirely algorithmic. . But, but the point is, you know, those are little, little snippets of information. Um, you know, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a lot of discovery, um, that&#8217;s inherent to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you, you end up finding [00:34:00] people to follow through others that you&#8217;re following through, through algorithmic recommendations depending on, on the platform. Um, and, you know, they&#8217;re little. Snippets of entertainment, you know, that don&#8217;t require a ton of engagement. You know, your, your average engagement there is, is measured in seconds, not minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s really just an endless stream of stuff that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s triggering your dopamine receptors, and, and, mm-hmm. , um, you know, making you entertained and abused. And look, there are creators that are creating like some really. Interesting, thoughtful, you know, content, whether it&#8217;s, you know, stuff that is pertinent to my industry, um, you know, historical content stuff that&#8217;s, you know, extremely socially aware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there&#8217;s a lot of stuff that you can get exposed to on this, on those platforms that&#8217;s, um, meaningful and interesting. And there&#8217;s a lot that&#8217;s just, you know, purely entertainment. It doesn&#8217;t have a lot of depth to it, but it makes you laugh or, you know, whatever. You [00:35:00] know, WordPress, I mean WordPress is a platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a tool. Um, it lets people create a different type of content. Um, you know, typically, typically written content, uh, which requires a longer engagement time. And of course there are plenty of people who would rather, you know, engaged with, with a creator, um, you know, through written content, um, that has more depth to it, you know, that that takes longer to read and digest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re certainly gonna. You know, probably retain something better and get something more, you know, rich and meaningful out, out of that type of engagement. Um, but, you know, it&#8217;s, but again, WordPress is an open source distributed platform. It&#8217;s not just like Instagram or, or TikTok or Twitter, which has an app that you install on your phone and everyone&#8217;s using the same app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, a word WordPress sites are hosted across the internet in, in a million different places. , you know, and, and there are certainly some big, um, consolidated hosting platforms like wordpress.com, but, [00:36:00] um, you know, you&#8217;re not, it&#8217;s not like every WordPress creator in the world is being merged into this like, you know, central funnel where it&#8217;s just piped into, you know, a single place that everyone&#8217;s engaging with those creators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think it&#8217;s a lot more challenging for, for the WordPress creator in general to find their market. You know, some of them will, can leverage those other platforms, you know, to bring them back to their blog and or, you know, to their site to continue to engage with them. But, um, you know, it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re all collaborating together and, and feeding into an algorithm in, in the creator economy of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it&#8217;s an entirely different beast. Um, you know, I would say that the. WordPress software creators, those that are building plugins through the, you know, wordpress.org, you know, plugin directory. Prob probably have something closer to that than, than the creators who actually created the content. Do you know, just by virtue of using WordPress, of course, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller: Yeah, yeah. The repo is the central [00:37:00] community in a sense, in a way to launch a market, for sure. Okay. Thank you for that. I wanted to, I wanted to segue for a moment cuz I th this is a topic I think we continue to be talking about in the WordPress ecosystem, um, because it&#8217;s how I got started in millions and millions of other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, being able to click publish on your dream, use the software to do something cool and build a business, whether it&#8217;s like you said, the software or the content. Okay. Next topic real quick as we kind of wind down. I want to ask about is what you&#8217;re seeing on WordPress and the enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> Um, again, again, a topic suitable for an entire podcast episode, maybe even a podcast series, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I agree. Well, I mean, look, word, word Press has been, You know, enterprise software now for, you know, I would say at least 10 years, probably a little bit longer than that. Um, you know, to me the real dividing line was when [00:38:00] WordPress b i p spun up, you know, that that was when, uh, I start, started to see the really big sites came on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when we, that&#8217;s when we started to really, you know, work on the really big sites. You know, our, our first, our first enterprise WordPress launches were the Kaiser Family Foundation and New York Post on, on a very early version of, of, you know, WordPress VIP, um, And you know, back then it was, um, you know, there, there were, those were, they were the early adopters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were the ones that saw the, not just the value of WordPress software, but the value of using open source in the enterprise. You know, the having real control over, uh, , um, their software, you know, the, the, the software behind the site was portable. If they decided they didn&#8217;t like their hosting company, they, they could move, they could change anything that they wanted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but the thing that they were starting with WordPress was already pretty good out of the box. So, you know, that was actually pretty minimal. Um, You know, then, you know, a [00:39:00] few years later you had the really, the next big group of, of publishers that we worked with that, um, you know, saw the early adopters were having success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They wanted to be on board. Um, you know, now, uh, I&#8217;m seeing a lot of competition in the market for. You know, from other platforms, um, platforms that are closed source, um, that are, you know, in the long term, more expensive in, in cost of ownership. Um, but you know, the challenge when I&#8217;m talking to, you know, a, a potential client about a project, you know, whether it&#8217;s a nonprofit or a media publisher, it doesn&#8217;t matter. It ends up being a, a similar conversation. Um, you know, I&#8217;m not ever competing against another WordPress agency. I&#8217;m almost always competing against another platform. And, you know, that, and, and it could be something like Arc, bright Spot, um, you know, and even I even see, you know, rebel Mouse every now and then, [00:40:00] um, in, in those sorts of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like the difference between WordPress. Pretty much any other platform is it, you know, not everything is, is included out of the box. Um, you know, with many other platforms you&#8217;re seeing, you know, A A C M S that has analytics included, um, you know, probably more, uh, workflow tools for a large newsroom. Um, especially in, you know, in the case of arc, um, you know, video tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, You know, uh, lots of, lots of other integrations that you know, you, which WordPress is perfectly capable of handling. You know, there are excellent enter enterprise plugins that connect to pretty much any advertising analytics video provider. Um, you know, uh, third, you know, third party authentication provider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take, take your pick of like what enterprise software, you know, you need to integrate with WordPress. Um, there, there&#8217;s probably a plugin for it and. It&#8217;s probably [00:41:00] an enterprise plugin and it probably works really well and gets you, you know, 90% of the way to, to where you need to go. Um, and you know, to me more importantly, You know, you have a choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, you know, if you, if you buy an off, if you, if you sign up with a large, you know, platform that does everything, all in one, um, and you don&#8217;t like their video solution, you&#8217;re stuck. Um, you know, you don&#8217;t have the choice of switching from, you know, Brightcove, the JW player. You know, if, if you think that, that, you know, it meets the needs of your product better, you, you don&#8217;t have that option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the problem, you know, comes into play is, you know, when you get to the point of, you know, negotiating business terms and sending a proposal and talking to people in the, you know, in, in procurement, you know, who&#8217;re trying to compare apples to apples to make the, the best decision for their organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they have, you know, platforms A and B that have all these things built in. Um, you know, this is, this is a [00:42:00] startup cost, this is the monthly fee, and that&#8217;s it. And although WordPress, you know, you&#8217;re getting all the software for free, um, you know, you&#8217;re probably going to hire someone like us to at least help with the initial build and, and, you know, do some integration work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you, you have to pick your hosting provider. Um, so, and then there&#8217;s gonna be an, a monthly cost for that, you know, maybe a startup cost for, for us, and then maybe a monthly cost for us. In the end result, you know, it&#8217;s not gonna take probably any longer to migrate all your content and get set up with WordPress, um, you know, through that method than than signing up for one of these other platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re gonna have a better experience because you know, you have so much more optionality and. Where you host, who you work with and, and what you integrate with. Um, you&#8217;re not paying any licensing fees. You know, you&#8217;re not beholden to a single provider and their business model and their pricing model, um, to run the most critical aspect of your [00:43:00] business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you can control all of that on your own, but that moment when you&#8217;re making the decision. and comparing it for some, for some of the folks that we talked to, I think that it does, it does seem more complex, um, because it sounds like there&#8217;s more work to do. Um, there are more choices to make, um, you know, versus just deciding and picking, you know, one thing versus the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and I think that that&#8217;s a challenge, you know, in, in the, in the enterprise market, which is like, That initial, you know, quote unquote out of the box demo of, of enterprise WordPress, um, you know, isn&#8217;t necessarily as, as well formed as it is for, for some of its competitors. Um, you know, for folks that really understand the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of open source folks that, especially that have used the WordPress before. Um, it, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not a challenge, but, you know, for, for, for organizations that are coming into this really, [00:44:00] um, you know, cold maybe from a proprietary platform trying to make that, that decision, I think it can be, it can be somewhat confusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so the, I mean, I think that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s one of the, the big challenges that I think, you know, enterprise WordPress faces, but, You know, how do you solve it? You know, I think that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the hard part because solving for that would mean, you know, being a bit more, um, being a bit more opinionated about, you know, things that are included in, in WordPress or, you know, for one of the big enterprise hosting platforms to, to pick a direction, um, and, and build bundle more stuff into the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that all of a sudden, you know, immediately, immediately becomes the antithesis of open. Um, so there&#8217;s a middle ground there somewhere. I, I don&#8217;t think that we found it yet. Um, and, and, and also if you read some of the stuff that, like, you know, Tom from Human Made and, and Magda from decode have written, you know, and, and talked about your podcast recently, um, you know, [00:45:00] It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s very much related to, you know, how we are all solving the, the same problems, you know, in different ways across all of our organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, hell, even in the early days of Guten Gutenberg, um, you know, years ago until we standardized, I saw different teams with an alley solving things in different ways. So, um, you know, there. There&#8217;s something to it because, you know, at least for increased collaboration, I think, you know, within our, within our enterprise community, because.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s to all of our benefit, I think that enterprise WordPress continues to succeed and thrive. Um, not just because, you know, I want my company to exist and, and to make money, but, um, if not us, then, then who? Because the, the other options that I see enterprise publishers going to are you. Big closed source platforms and, and that&#8217;s not something that I [00:46:00] believe in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I, I, I don&#8217;t think you should have to pay for software. If you&#8217;re spending money, you should be hiring people to write content, or you should be paying people, you know, to build the really custom aspects of your product that differentiate you, the things that make your business sustainable. The other stuff should be free, you know, and, and open source software is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it, it&#8217;s foundational to what the internet is so, . Um, yeah, I really hope absolutely that we can all get together and find a path forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s one of the reasons I created our, um, enterprise leaders group on post Slack, is I think the conversation needs to be had on multiple levels within the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but I, I&#8217;ve not. Personally been in enterprise work, ever have friends members, uh, that do this, and I go, I love work. What I hear WordPress is doing on that level, you, you know, from all the media organizations you represent. For instance, at Ali, I go, that&#8217;s [00:47:00] cool because when in my daily, I go out and like, what do you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I kind work around WordPress. What&#8217;s WordPress? Okay. But I go, it&#8217;s powering this percentage of the web, or you know, it&#8217;s the dominant thing on the web, uh, for publishing. Um, but also I get to hit those highlights. You&#8217;ve probably been on a WordPress hat and didn&#8217;t necessarily know it. These cool organizations are doing, using this open source tool and continuing to, I think it&#8217;s healthy for the open web to continue to fly the banner of freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, that open source and WordPress in particular, um, champion and to keep that going. I think it&#8217;s healthy for us as a a planet society business ecosystem. It, it seems like it&#8217;s all. Gonna be better when you have these great options, one of which is WordPress. Well, thank you Brad for, um, sharing the story, snippets of your join journey, the things that you&#8217;re doing [00:48:00] with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s all inspiring, and I know it&#8217;ll inspire the members here and those that are looking at click and publish with WordPress or using it in some way, shape, or form. Um, where can we find more about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> Of course. Yeah. If, if you want to, you know, learn more about Ali, uh, if you want to apply to work at Allie, we are still hiring developers currently and, and occasionally other positions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, just check out ali.com, uh, a l l e y.com.

The blocks, which are currently labeled as experimental, were first spotted by Jen T of <a href=\"https://wpcommaven.com/\">WPcomMaven</a> who published a few examples on her blog this week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com developed the blocks through a partnership with OpenAI, creators of ChatGPT and DALL·E. Automattic engineer Artur Piszek gave a quick overview of the experimental blocks in a <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/forums/topic/jetpack-ai/\">post</a> on the WordPress.com support forums, calling the new feature &#8220;Jetpack AI – your writing assistant on WordPress.com.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I took both blocks for a test drive, starting with the image generator. Users put in a prompt in a simple UI and the block generates four images, which can be expanded before selection. Here are a few examples: </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>I was not terribly impressed with the images, which every time seemed blurry and ill-conceived. Some of them bore an almost cruel likeness to the prompts, with living creatures and humans faring poorly compared to images of inanimate objects. The faces are almost always distorted with what appears to be bits of flesh melting off. Unless a user is unusually skilled in crafting the prompts, they may struggle to get any useful images.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The AI-generated paragraphs are a somewhat better experience but need more flexibility. The block will automatically generate new paragraphs based on your existing content. It does a decent job, but it would be more useful if you could start from a blank page and feed it a prompt instead, as one of the main benefits of using AI for generating content is that it can offer a starting place from which the writer can improve. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The content can be further edited by transforming the block into a paragraph. This isn&#8217;t easy to discover and would need to be emphasized better in the UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We were considering making the block outright editable, and I see that we may need to create a more intuitive editing experience,&#8221; Piszek said after reviewing feedback from users in the forum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When using this experimental paragraph-generating block, users may want to familiarize themselves with how AI-generated content can impact their search rankings.

Many users were driven to platforms like Mastodon to speculate about the reasons for Twitter breaking. Cloudflare also found some lucky timing today in <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/welcome-to-wildebeest-the-fediverse-on-cloudflare/\">launching Wildebeest</a>, an AcitivityPub and Mastodon-compatible server that enables anyone to operate their Fediverse server and identity on their domain with minimal setup and without needing to keep up the infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are looking to get started on Mastodon as the result of Twitter&#8217;s recent outage, WordPress developer Daniel Auener curates and maintains <a href=\"https://wp-community-on-mastodon.wptoots.social/\">a list of WordPress community members&#8217; Mastodon accounts</a> that anyone can follow by downloading a CSV file and importing it into Mastodon.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wp-community-on-mastodon.wptoots.social/\">list</a> includes all accounts, where the account owner has at least one community badge on their WordPress.org profile page.

Alex Stine, a fully blind individual contributor who has been working with the WordPress Accessibility team since 2016, is the first recipient of the fellowship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WPCC is managing its finances transparently on <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/thewpcc\">Open Collective</a>. The fellowship has yet to be fully funded. Just $645.63 USD of $15,000 (4%) has been raised for the Accessibility Fellowship, although individual memberships are at $3,589.75 USD of the organization&#8217;s $20,000 goal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve set up a few different ways folks can support the WPCC,&#8221; co-founder Sé Reed said. &#8220;We&#8217;re just launching our fundraising campaign for the Accessibility Fellowship now. So far, most of our contributors have opted to support us as members, with a recurring membership pledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Monthly membership funds go to our general fund, which will primarily be used to support our fellowships and projects. As of today, we&#8217;ve raised slightly more than $4k, with $3,600 of that reserved for the Accessibility Fellowship.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organization is currently in the process of finalizing sponsorships from a few large companies and is building out a corporate sponsorship program and a small business sponsorship program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t discuss anything yet as we&#8217;re still working out the details, but there is a lot happening that we hope to announce soon,&#8221; Reed said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the Accessibility fellowship is funded, Stine will continue his work with WordPress&#8217; Accessibility Team and will serve as the Team Rep, while continuing his private work as a consultant and an engineer at Waystar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am excited to have the opportunity to give back to the project that provided me with my start in the technology field,&#8221; Stine said. &#8220;I could not continue to give back at my current capacity without this generous program.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case the reasons why WordCamp Asia is such an important event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jutebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Naoko Takano.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few days from now, from the 17th to the 19th of February 2023, to be precise, the first in-person WordCamp Asia will take place in Bangkok, Thailand. If you follow WordPress events closely, then I&#8217;m sure that you&#8217;ve seen the excitement mounting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naoko is on the podcast today to talk about this important event, how it came to be, and why it matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start off getting some background on Naoko and her personal journey with WordPress. She&#8217;s currently sponsored full-time by Automattic to work with the wordpress.org community and polyglots teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation then turns to the event itself. It&#8217;s sold out, but you can still take parts by watching the live streams of the three tracks that are running.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the fact that, although this is the first in-person WordCamp Asia, it should not have been. WordCamp Asia was in the books for 2020. More or less everything was planned and prepared, and then Covid struck. The timing could not have been worse. It was heartbreaking. Naoko talks about the disappointment felt by the community, and how they&#8217;ve managed to maintain their commitment to making the event happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team that is putting on the current event, contains some people from the cancelled 2020 event, but there&#8217;s new members too, and they span many Asian countries. So there&#8217;s a real diversity in the organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast, we get into the important question of why we need a WordCamp Asia. Naoko makes the point that the other flagship WordPress events are not that accessible for some people. This could be because of the difficulty in acquiring visas for the U.S. Or Europe, but also the costs of traveling to the event, and accommodation whilst there. It&#8217;s hoped that WordCamp Asia will provide a chance for a whole new audience to attend, in a location which is closer to home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We wrap up with Naoko explaining how WordCamp Asia aims to differ from the other events through their vision of being welcoming, nurturing, and experimental.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re attending WordCamp Asia your in-person or online, this podcast will give you a new perspective on the event. And if you&#8217;re not planning on being there, maybe this episode will make you rethink.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Naoko Takano.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Naoko Takano. Hello Naoko.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:20] Naoko Takano: Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:21] Nathan Wrigley: Very nice to have you on the podcast today. We&#8217;re going to be talking today about a very exciting subject, a very new, an exciting event called WordCamp Asia. We&#8217;ll get onto why it&#8217;s not quite as new as it may seem a little bit later. But first Naoko, I wonder if you wouldn&#8217;t mind just giving us a little potted history about yourself, about your relationship with WordPress, your history with WordPress and WordPress events, and things like that. So it&#8217;s over to you. Introduce yourself please.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:51] Naoko Takano: Sure. I&#8217;m Naoko Takano based in Tokyo. I&#8217;ve been using WordPress for as long as WordPress has been around actually. So it&#8217;s been 20 years now. I started using WordPress as a personal blog platform, since I was living in the US and I wanted to have a place to write in Japanese, to communicate online. And then it, it&#8217;s a long story since then. I started building websites. Then became a front end engineer. Then became a freelancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, I actually started organizing WordCamps in Japan, Tokyo. And then I met Matt Mullenweg at WordCamp in Japan. And since then, I got hired by Automattic as a support engineer. And then, since 2019, I am a community manager of WordPress.org. I&#8217;m a full-time sponsored volunteer for wordpress.org community and polyglots team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:49] Nathan Wrigley: You really do have a very long history with WordPress. Yeah. It&#8217;s very rare that I bump into somebody who has 20 years of WordPress under their belt. That&#8217;s most impressive. Well, thank you for joining us on the show today. We are here to talk about WordCamp Asia, which is going to be happening if all the stars align, and this podcast episode is published on the date I&#8217;m expecting it to be published.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be just around the corner. It&#8217;ll be a matter of days, possibly just over a week before the event is coming around. There must be great excitement in your part of the world about it. Do you want to just lay out for us when and where it is. So just the nuts and the bolts of when it&#8217;s happening, where it is, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:31] Naoko Takano: Sure. So, the first WordCamp Asia will be happening in 2023. Is from 17th to 19th, February. It&#8217;s a three day event in Thailand, Bangkok, Thailand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:47] Nathan Wrigley: And it&#8217;s happening at the, now, forgive me if I get the name of this wrong. It&#8217;s the True Icon Hall. Is that the name of the venue?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:55] Naoko Takano: That&#8217;s correct. That&#8217;s correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:56] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s a conference center in the middle of Bangkok.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:59] Naoko Takano: Yes. it&#8217;s a newly built conference hall. I think they were built in 2019, and it&#8217;s by the Chao Phraya River. And it&#8217;s part of the Icon Siam Complex and it&#8217;s very beautiful place even there in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:17] Nathan Wrigley: Excellent, excellent. Now, I think it&#8217;s probably important to say at this point that if you are not in possession of a ticket, no matter what we say, don&#8217;t make plans to go to WordCamp Asia. Because my understanding is that the full amount of tickets, I think it&#8217;s 1,500, have in fact sold out. Is that true?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:36] Naoko Takano: Yes, at the moment, we don&#8217;t have any plan for releasing any batch of tickets. You may be able to get refunded tickets that will be released as they come back. But unless one of the very lucky ones that will get these very few refunded tickets. We don&#8217;t have any plan on raising any big amount of tickets anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:58] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, well that&#8217;s okay though because if you are keen to participate in WordCamp Asia and do not have a ticket and have no plans to attend. My understanding is, and you can confirm this I hope, is that the event itself will be live streamed, in the way that we&#8217;ve been used to over the last couple of years, is that in fact true?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:18] Naoko Takano: Yes. We have three tracks and all the tracks will be live streamed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:22] Nathan Wrigley: Great. Even if you don&#8217;t possess a ticket, you&#8217;ll be able to get there. So we have WordCamp Europe, these great big, I&#8217;m going to say international events. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a correct terminology for these kind of flagship events. But we&#8217;ve got WordCamp Europe, we&#8217;ve got WordCamp US, and now into the mix we have WordCamp Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So obviously the first event actually happening. But there is a sort of disappointing story behind this, because if you are following the WordPress news and you have been since 2019, you&#8217;ll know that the event, tragically, I&#8217;m going to use that word, had to be cancelled more or less at the last moment due to the Covid outbreak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to get into that a little bit? Might be interesting to hear the story. It was, if memory serves, very much several weeks away, it was really, really close, and the whole thing got pulled. With hindsight, that was probably a very wise decision. But at the time, I remember community members who, as yet, we&#8217;re unable to grasp the scope of Covid because it really hadn&#8217;t gone anywhere yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was much gnashing of teeth and rending of clothes and people sort of saying, oh, what a shame. Just tell us from your perspective, because I know you were on the team for that. What was that disappointment like to suffer through?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:40] Naoko Takano: So, yes, WordCamp Asia 2020 was the first WordCamp that was cancelled due to Covid 19. And that was the end of February in 2020, that was supposed to happen. And, because I think it was probably the first event that was cancelled due to pandemic of any type of situation in the world, in the whole history of WorldCamps. And we just couldn&#8217;t believe that happened. We always believed WordCamp will be planned and it will happen, you know, when the day comes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was such a loss to us. To me it was like losing someone by an accident. Just lost someone, you know, or something that was so sure. That you were looking forward to. It was very, very crushing for us. At the time we didn&#8217;t understand the amount of what&#8217;s coming. So, we actually rescheduled it for the same year and we did that twice. And then after that we didn&#8217;t say anything for sure about the upcoming schedule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:47] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, incredibly disappointing. I actually do want to dwell on this for a little bit longer, if you don&#8217;t mind. Because if you&#8217;ve ever been to a WordCamp, maybe that&#8217;s in a city near you or one of the bigger ones, as we&#8217;ve just described, Europe or US. You&#8217;ll probably have understood the amount of organization that goes into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not an event which comes up and is organized several weeks in advance. This is something that takes a lot of people, a very large amount of time to organize. There&#8217;s speakers, there&#8217;s venues, there&#8217;s sponsors, there&#8217;s meals, there&#8217;s accessibility. There&#8217;s a whole host of things going. And for the rest of us, it was simply a case of, oh, it&#8217;s been cancelled. Well that&#8217;s disappointing. Perhaps I&#8217;ve got to get a refund on my air travel, or perhaps I don&#8217;t have to do anything because I wasn&#8217;t attending anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point being that it was simply a question that it was cancelled. Whereas for you and the community that had gathered together to organize it, it must have been, like you said, crushing. And I&#8217;m just wondering how easy it was to get people back on board this time around. Or whether people left the WordCamp ecosystem and decided, I&#8217;m not getting involved with that again. How&#8217;s it been?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:05] Naoko Takano: So the bright side of things is that we became stronger team because of the challenges that we had to face. But situations changed for many people. You know, three years is a long time. So we did lose some people due to changing their situation or commitment level. They could promise after three years. But, we did have nice number of people who came back. I would say in the beginning of reunion, I would say probably like 80%. Everybody wanted to come back and do it again because we weren&#8217;t able to. So, yeah, it wasn&#8217;t like a disbanding of the whole community organizers, but we came back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:47] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that&#8217;s remarkable. Sometimes I have to pinch myself when I think about WordPress and the fact that this little piece of software, which began 20 years ago, which probably didn&#8217;t have any pretensions of growing to the size that it is now. Yeah, I have to pinch myself for the breadth and the depth, the amazing spread globally of the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;ve kindly written in the show notes a list of the countries that people have come from in order to assemble WordCamp Asia, this year, 2023. And I&#8217;m just going to read it out because it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s amazing. So we&#8217;ve got participants or volunteers, I should say, helping to organize from the following countries, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. I mean, that&#8217;s just remarkable. Very impressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:45] Naoko Takano: Yeah. I think it&#8217;s, that&#8217;s why we were so fascinated and amazed with this community. Because, I think there&#8217;s rare chance that you get to work with such a diverse group of people around the world, around Asia. And in itself organizing is interesting and learning experience and also community building experience, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:08] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. If I was to assist with the WordCamp US team, I&#8217;m guessing that a lot of them would come from the US and so broadly speaking, their backgrounds would be quite similar. And although Europe is perhaps a little bit more different from country to country. You know, if you go from the southern part of Europe to the northern part of Europe there are differences in the cultures. But they&#8217;re not tremendously different, shall we say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas you&#8217;ve got from India to Pakistan, to the Philippines, to Taiwan and Thailand. That must be a really interesting collection of people, because, I would imagine that the countries that they come from are very different in very great respects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:48] Naoko Takano: Yeah, we have different culture, different style of communication. Only, I think, small percentage of us speak English as native language, or day-to-day, everyday language. So there&#8217;s big barrier around communication style. But as I said, it&#8217;s also like an experience that you can&#8217;t get outside of this community, especially as a such tight group that you talk to every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the difference between other type of contribution in WordPress. WordCamp organization is very interesting in experience that we get to learn about each other very deeply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:29] Nathan Wrigley: Can I ask how you do, do the organization? We&#8217;ll come into how long you&#8217;ve been preparing this event in a moment. But what are you using? I know that typically things like Slack may involved. But also are you, broadly speaking, communicating in English across the team? How is it working? So what tools are you using and what language have you tended to default to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:52] Naoko Takano: Yeah, so the communication tool that we used the most is Slack. And we are on it, the same Slack, separate from Make WordPress. And then we use English. But there are channels that are used by local members. For example, we have a Japanese channel to do some chit chat or ask question in our language. And local team has Thai channel to communicate with each other. But the overall language is in English. And we use Zoom to have meetings. So it&#8217;s like work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>work If</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:25] Nathan Wrigley: I was somebody living in, let&#8217;s say, I don&#8217;t know, just to pick one off the list, Nepal, and my English was not sufficient, let&#8217;s say to carry out the tasks that may be needed by a volunteer. What happens there? Is there any encouragement or any, anything that can be done, or is it essentially you would need a modest amount of English in order to participate, in order to communicate with the team? Or could somebody from say Nepal, work with other Nepalese people speaking the language that they have, Nepali, I believe it is? I&#8217;m sorry for my ignorance there. Nepalese, I apologize. What do you do around all of that? If somebody doesn&#8217;t have the mastery of English, that might be needed to communicate over the whole project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:08] Naoko Takano: So we don&#8217;t require a mastery of English because that would be very hard barrier to participate. But we do select, we do vet organizers based on their community involvement, in their local community. And also some English is of course needed. But you don&#8217;t have to be able to speak fluently as long as they can communicate. While on Slack, you can use translation tool on your own. That&#8217;s okay. So as long as you can communicate on Slack, we would like to see active community organisers regardless of English fluency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:46] Nathan Wrigley: I understand. Yeah, thank you. Okay, so it&#8217;s a silly question, but I&#8217;m going to ask it anyway. Why do we need a WordCamp Asia? We have lots of events. I&#8217;m imagining there&#8217;s lots of WordCamps spread throughout Asia. But at some point, WordCamp Europe came along and WordCamp US. Why did the community feel there was a need for that? And I&#8217;m really just offering you that question so that you can answer it. I don&#8217;t actually think, well, why do we need a WordCamp Asia? That&#8217;s not the intention of the question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:18] Naoko Takano: Yeah, thanks for asking because I like to share why we are so enthusiastic about holding WordCamp Asia in person in Thailand. This might be little known, but there are very unique barriers to attending existing flagship events for residents in Asia. Like visa, obtaining visa to go to US it&#8217;s very, very hard for many people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some people Europe, it&#8217;s also not easy to travel in terms of cost and time. And then also for people attending online, watching streaming in real time. Time zone difference is very hard, both in US and Europe, to participate in real time. So we want to cater this event to Asian residents to have the same kind of experience that many of the organizers had experienced in WordCamp Europe, WordCamp US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we want to bring this great feeling, great communication, connection to Asian community. So that they can easily attend in an affordable price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:29] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that&#8217;s interesting. The affordable thing speaks for itself, I suppose. But in terms of the visas, that&#8217;s a really interesting one. Obviously it&#8217;s completely outside of WordPress. It&#8217;s a political thing, but my understanding is that in some jurisdictions it is very difficult to get a visa, let&#8217;s say, for the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you are, really it&#8217;s an up hill struggle if you want to attend those events. And I&#8217;m expecting from what you&#8217;ve just said, that the relationship between Asian countries is more open. So as an example, a visitor coming to Thailand, I&#8217;m guessing there&#8217;s less barriers to actually applying for and successfully getting those visas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:11] Naoko Takano: Yes, relatively speaking, especially Bangkok. We chose Bangkok as the first city, host city, mainly because visa accessibility and also flights from main Asian cities. So that&#8217;s into our consideration for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:29] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, there&#8217;s lots of, amazing options in terms of flights, isn&#8217;t there? But also Bangkok itself is such a, an amazing and vibrant city and has absolutely heaps of accommodation options as well, doesn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s a really good place to kick it off for WordCamp Asia. Speaking of kicking it off, how did it all get started?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, obviously there was the event which was destined to happen in 2020, so we&#8217;re going back before then. Were you part of the team? How did it actually all begin and how did you assemble this event? Because you can&#8217;t just suddenly announce, we&#8217;re going to do WordCamp Asia. There must be an awful lot of backwards and forwards, perhaps talking to people at Automattic and various other organizations to get it all started. Do you know about how it all began?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:12] Naoko Takano: Yes, so the direct event that led to WordCamp Asia application was the contributor day at WordCamp Bangkok 2019. I wasn&#8217;t attending actually, but a group of community organizers who had been traveling to go to different WordCamps outside of the country met in person and they decided to apply at that time. But the same, or some of the same, people had been traveling since, I would say 2014, 15 and going to each other&#8217;s countries or flagship events and making connections and becoming friends. And then from that kind of connection, this idea came around and it came to, came to happen, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:00] Nathan Wrigley: And so how much time and well, effort is harder to measure, but in terms of time, how long have you, you and the team, been working on this version of WordCamp Asia? So the 2023 one. How far back do we go before you decided, yep. A, we&#8217;re going to go for it, and B, it&#8217;s going to be in February, 2023. How much time have you been spending on this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:23] Naoko Takano: So yeah, at the end of 2021, we reunited on a Zoom call and started talking about restarting this effort, because we always wanted to find the time to come back to Bangkok. By the time of spring 2022, we started actually working on the event organizing. And through 2022 we&#8217;ve worked and now it&#8217;s getting really close. We are very excited about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:51] Nathan Wrigley: Nice. Now, in terms of the event itself, obviously the location is new and interesting for a whole selection of the audience, I imagine. Perhaps many of them have never been to Thailand in particular. Perhaps never been to Asia. We&#8217;ll wait and see how that all goes. So there&#8217;s obviously that, it&#8217;s going to be different because it&#8217;s in a, a new and interesting part of the world for these flagship events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in terms of the event, from your perspective, what is the vision? What&#8217;s the thing that you talk to people about when you say, okay, this is going to be great, this is going to be new and different. What&#8217;s the vision that you are, you are letting everybody know about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:32] Naoko Takano: So yeah, as a WordCamp Asia organizing team, we didn&#8217;t want to make another event that&#8217;s just like WordCamp US or just like WordCamp Europe. That wasn&#8217;t our intention. We wanted to make a unique event. We have three visions that are welcoming, nurturing, and experimental.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we wanted to create an event that&#8217;s true to our culture, which is inclusive and diverse. And then also we wanted to have this event because we wanted to nurture the community in Asia. Not because we wanted to have this big event just because. We all came together because of WordCamps. We became friends and community builders because of other WordCamps. So we wanted this event to ignite more communities in Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also we wanted to do something different. So that&#8217;s the experimental part. And we want to do the first event in Asia that&#8217;s flagship. So we want to, while people with our creative activity, our design teams doing a great job. And I like to see how people feel when they come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:44] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, it&#8217;s going to be really interesting seeing what people&#8217;s reactions are. You&#8217;ve got 1500 attendees. I don&#8217;t know exactly how many people are involved on the, the organizing side, but it will be, it&#8217;ll be interesting to see what the conversations are like in the hall. How is this different? What are we enjoying about it? As much for the location, Thailand and Bangkok and all of that. It&#8217;ll be really interesting to see what people&#8217;s discussions are. So the vision can be boiled down to three words. It&#8217;s going to be welcoming, it&#8217;s going to be nurturing, and it&#8217;s going to be experimental.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of, well sadly, getting back to Covid, which one doesn&#8217;t really want to, but it appears, certainly at this point in time, Covid has become part of the news cycle again. It felt, in my country at least anyway, that it had dropped off and it wasn&#8217;t being talked about. And more recently it is getting some more attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m just wondering if there&#8217;s anything that you need to disseminate in terms of masking or restrictions or vaccinations, anything like that, which Thailand may enforce, or indeed just your event is enforcing. Because that&#8217;s probably a very important component of people&#8217;s safety should they decide to attend in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:54] Naoko Takano: Yeah, this is a frequently asked question. And at the moment of this recording, we are not making masking or vaccination mandatory. So this is based on community teams guideline for WordCamps. If that changes we will change our guidelines accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if Thailand requirement changes, we would have to abide by that. But at the moment we are not requiring masking or vaccination. They&#8217;re both recommended. And we will provide stickers for people who like to be respected. So we ask people to stay away or wear masks around people with those stickers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:32] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. So there&#8217;s going to be some symbol that you can wear, a sticker that you can have if you would wish to have a little bit of separation between you and other people. And the hope is people will notice those stickers and give you a, a wider birth than might normally be the case. Okay, that&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So given that your tickets have sold out. 1500 seats have been snapped up, bought, and hopefully they&#8217;ll all be filled during the event. Given all of that, and I know you won&#8217;t be able to tell me much about this, but I do want to ask anyway. Do you know if we are planning to have a WordCamp Asia 2024? I know it&#8217;s a bit early for that, but do you see that the community has rallied around and is beginning to talk about that? Because, you know, no sooner is one event finished than the other one needs to be announced. And in fact, in many of these flagship events the location of the next event is announced during the conference itself. So yeah, as much as you can say, but you may not be able to say much .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:33] Naoko Takano: So yeah, in fact at the moment we have the call of host city for 2024 open. But by the time this is, we might not have it open. So we&#8217;ll be reviewing those applications and we are hoping we will be able to announce during, or the end of, the event. Yeah, just keep your excitement until we announce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:56] Nathan Wrigley: So it sounds like if the call for venues has gone out, there&#8217;s definitely going to be one, but we don&#8217;t as yet, know where it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:05] Naoko Takano: Yes, we do have applications that came in. So, a city will be selected, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:11] Nathan Wrigley: So hopefully this will be a podcast that we get to repeat each year, and it will be the first of many. I really appreciate you chatting to us today Naoko about WordCamp Asia and about its first well, not that it should have been the first, but it&#8217;s first live, in-person, event. I hope it goes well. I really, really do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for talking to us today. Just before I let you go, is there anything that I missed or is there something that you would like to have said that we didn&#8217;t say? That could be just telling people where the website address is, should they wish to have a look at that? It could be, I don&#8217;t know, a Twitter handle that you are keen to promote. Anything you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:50] Naoko Takano: Sure, our website is asia.wordcamp.org/2023. And just wish us the best of the luck because, we need a lot of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:00] Nathan Wrigley: From my point of view, you have all of those wishes. I really hope it goes extremely well. I would wish you the greatest success. Hopefully in a couple of months time we&#8217;ll be able to chat about how successful it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naoko, thank you very much for chatting to me today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:17] Naoko Takano: Thank you for having me.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today, we have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nao/\">Naoko Takano</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few days from now, from the 17th to the 19th February 2023, to be precise, the first in-person <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Asia</a> will take place in Bangkok, Thailand. If you follow WordPress events closely, then I’m sure that you’ve seen the excitement mounting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naoko is on the podcast today to talk about this important event; how it came to be and why it matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start off getting some background on Naoko and her personal journey with WordPress. She’s currently sponsored full time by Automattic to work with the wordpress.org community and polyglots teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation then turns to the event itself. It’s sold out, but you can still take part by watching the live streams of the three tracks that are running.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the fact that, although this is the first in-person WordCamp Asia, it should not have been. WordCamp Asia was in the books for 2020. More or less everything was planned and prepared, and then Covid struck. The timing could not have been worse, it was heartbreaking. Naoko talks about the disappointment felt by the community and how they’ve managed to maintain their commitment to making the event happen. The team that is putting on the current event contains some people from the cancelled 2020 event, but there&#8217;re new members too, and they span many Asian countries, so there’s a real diversity in the organisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast, we get into the important question of why we need a WordCamp Asia. Naoko makes the point that the other ‘flagship’ WordPress events are not that accessible for some people. This could be because of the difficulty in acquiring visas for the U.S. or Europe, but also the costs of travelling to the event and accommodation whilst there. It’s hoped that WordCamp Asia will provide a chance for a whole new audience to attend in a location which is closer to home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We wrap up with Naoko explaining how WordCamp Asia aims to differ from other events through their vision of being welcoming, nurturing and experimental.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re attending WordCamp Asia in-person or online, this podcast will give you a new perspective on the event, and if you’re not planning on being there, maybe this episode will make you rethink.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Asia 2023 website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023/location/\">WordCamp Asia 2023 location</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 08 Feb 2023 15:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"Gutenberg Times: Quick Tip: Creating a custom webpack configuration file\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=23317\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/quick-tip-creating-a-custom-webpack-configuration-file/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4831:\"<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VgK_Y9wAGXw\">Ryan Welcher on YouTube Shorts. </a>&#8211; <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@ryanwelchercodes/video/7195978911073717510\">Also available on TikTok </a>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Ryan Welcher </strong>started a recording YouTube Shorts also available on TikTok.

This ensures that the scripts package can detect and compile our blocks.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Step 4:</strong> In the <code>module.exports</code> object,\n<ul>\n<li>add the <code>defaultConfig</code> using the spread operator.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add an <code>entry</code> object,&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>spread the results of <code>getWebpackEntryPoints</code>, and

the best version of me.\" />\nHere is Samantha reading her own story aloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The first time I put my hands on a computer was in kindergarten. Once a week we’d go up to the top floor where no other regular classes were held. Inside, there were dozens of giant computers (a bit later, shiny new Macintosh Classics) in three long rows. We learned BASIC at 5 years old. We played Oregon Trail and Gertrude’s Secrets. I loved my computer class, and not just because it was always ice cold in the room. That was the only place I got to use computers for years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My great-grandmother, not really a fan of <em>anyone</em>, had always liked me. Around this time, she pulled me aside and told me, “Stick with the computers.” She was convinced that was the way to make money. I smiled and nodded. I don’t think she’d ever seen one in person.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My dad took me to a store in Marine Park when I was in 6th grade. I walked around the store in awe of what was available — and the prices. He bought a Packard Bell computer that had fewer megahertz than our home phone — but it was glorious. I begged for a game not included in the bundle — Myst, which I’d seen my best friend’s mom play. I became glued to my computer. We didn’t even have the internet yet. I’d spend hours on Myst and then printing pictures and articles from Grolier’s Encyclopedia about stealth planes (don’t ask).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_b899ae-51 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Getting Online</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time I was in high school, everyone had AOL. Using AOL Hometown web hosting to “expand” your profile was what all the cool kids did. We’d fill it with webrings, poor resolution photos, glittery animations, song lyrics — all a manifestation of our personalities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The “cool kid” Samantha wanted to be a writer. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When LiveJournal came on to the scene I started blogging and making online friends — but somehow it still didn’t feel like “my” space (zero pun intended). When I first heard about WordPress, I was jazzed about it. It felt like the grownup version of LiveJournal — and blew past AOL Hometown. But, nobody else I knew was using it. Of course there were others I didn’t know that were, but for me it felt special and unique because my little sphere of the world wasn’t catching on to the “new hotness” yet. It also felt more “me” than anything else I’d dabbled with. I have had <em>many</em> accounts over the years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had taught myself basic HTML to edit my early “sites” and MySpace profile. I’d go through phases. I’d post religiously, hate my work, and then nuke the whole thing. I’d forget I had one for a while. I’d start all over and make something beautiful — only to fall out of love with it. What I didn’t realize is that I kept learning a valuable skill.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_f97dc7-19 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Finding My Path</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time I was in college, I had all but abandoned the creative bursts of poetry, prose, and short stories. I was going to major in psychology. That lasted as long as the guy who registered me for my first classes told me it would. I fell in love with English. I took as many courses as I could with the professors that encapsulated what I wanted to be — and created another WordPress blog.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time I bought a domain, something no one I knew had done at the time. I did a bit of searching and figured out how to point CNAME records to A records. Now I had my own site, and I was going hard on content creation.&nbsp; I decided I wouldn’t just teach English. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I’d be a poet, and people would come across my site and my words would change them, like the authors I had read changed me.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And then eventually I deleted that too. Periodically I’d also get dumb ideas that I found very funny, buy a domain, and create a single-use site (I think my favorite was “GeraldoRiverasMustache.com” where the only thing on the page was a cropped picture of his mustache). Deleted. At one point, friends and I started a blog where we actually got to interview a couple of celebrities as part of a larger plan that didn’t come to fruition. Deleted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got certified to teach and began tutoring at another college, eventually getting a position as an adjunct lecturer. There, I also wanted to change people — and my students and I organized a small concert in Coney Island. I made a site, posted updates, and pictures after the event. Deleted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_bde166-28 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Finding WordPress In The Wild</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to leave teaching at some point and found a job at an online conference company. One of the requirements was knowing WordPress — lucky, lucky. I was hired. It wasn’t the bulk of the job. I was a glorified assistant that helped edit audio and video, help with online conferences, whatever was needed. But, since I knew WordPress, I could go in and update copy, change settings as needed, make new landing pages for events, and so on. Learning, still — not ever expecting to do more with it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, I moved halfway across the country to live with my now-husband. We’d known each other for many years from a video game related social blogging site (not WordPress, but the UI was very similar so I was in my element). Now years later, I needed a job.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I leveraged my experience with computers, education, and WordPress to get a job at a nonprofit. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When they migrated their outdated site — an incredibly long and problematic process — the person who was in charge of that was fired partway through. I was brought in to help. I took a look at the CMS and said to myself … “Is this just WordPress?” It pretty much was, with some membership management component. It was as intuitive and easy to navigate, so I was able to help.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of jobs (and blogs)&nbsp; later, I found myself miserable in the midst of a pandemic. Besides not having a creative outlet, my talent as an employee wasn’t really being fully utilized. It wore on me the longer I was there. I could be doing so much more. I threw myself into a digital marketing certification program — knowing all my work is always on computers, I’m comfortable with computers, and my last job was essentially marketing anyway. And then I found a job in WordPress hosting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_bb8cde-28 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Coming Home</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I knew WordPress. Not the dev side, but I could get a lot further than someone who’d never used it before. This was opening a new but familiar door. The certification course helped me learn more about what I wanted to do, but not nearly as much as working in WordPress hosting itself did.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m in content, so I get to read, research, and write about WordPress and adjacent topics. I’m going on two years in this position. I love working in the WordPress space. It’s far less stressful than any other job I’ve worked because it’s familiar and comfortable. Tech was the right space for my skills and my personality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Growing up on the internet, I didn’t think about how what I was learning would end up having such a profound impact on my day-to-day life. I was simply trying to fit in and, at times, one-up everyone else’s skills. I never thought the place I used to post crappy poetry would eventually pay my bills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The work I do doesn’t just help customers learn and become inspired — working in this space keeps me “updated.” For as many versions of WordPress there have been, there’s as many versions of Samantha. That malleability is innate to WordPress. You can reinvent yourself over and over, and their developers have only made that easier to accomplish over the years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Now that I’ve found my comfort zone, something that would have been impossible had I never used WordPress — I’ve also addressed my creative zone again. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>My main WordPress site is a satire news blog that brings me joy even if it doesn’t have the traffic that The Onion gets. WordPress has more or less helped me find the best version of me, even if I’m named after Bewitched and not a famous jazz artist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Topher put out the request for essays that depicted how WordPress made my life better, I knew he wasn’t going to get a couple of paragraphs from me. I’m still the same blogger that is going type up a Tolstoy and want to delete it. I won’t this time, but, I can also sum it up quickly. <strong><em>I</em></strong> was built on WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes, Great-grandma. I stuck with the computers.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/i-am-built-on-wordpress/\">I am built on WordPress.</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 08 Feb 2023 08:00:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"Samantha Mueller\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: WordPress Opens Applications for 2023 Community Summit\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=141745\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-opens-applications-for-2023-community-summit\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2386:\"<p>The WordPress open source project will be <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2023/02/08/apply-to-attend-the-2023-community-summit/#comment-30688\">hosting a Community Summit</a> as part of WordCamp US this year. It will take place prior to the main conference on August 22-23, 2023, in National Harbor, Washington, DC.

This plugin is the result of a ten-year-old effort to migrate BuddyPress’ custom URI parser to use WordPress’ Rewrite API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One year ago, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/bp-rewrites-feature-plugin-now-in-beta\">BP Rewrites went into beta</a>. It&#8217;s not certain how the change will interact with different plugins, so BP developers recommended it be tested for at least two major BuddyPress core releases before considering a merge. Early testers <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/bp-rewrites/\">uncovered many incompatibilities</a> and conflicts with various BuddyPress features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to move forward confidently with support for users who may experience plugin conflicts, BP Rewrites&#8217; maintainers have decided to create a new plugin that will provide backward compatibility. This new plugin will be called <a href=\"https://github.com/buddypress/bp-classic\">BP Classic</a> and will also contain BuddyPress&#8217; legacy widgets, a change that BuddyPress core developer Mathieu Viet said &#8220;will be our first move towards progressively rebooting BuddyPress.&#8221; <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-9-0-0-transforms-legacy-widgets-into-blocks\">BP 9.0.0</a> (released July 2021) gave users the ability to transform legacy widgets into a block with two clicks.

We have a few participants here. Hi there, welcome to our 33rd Gutenberg Times Live Q&amp;A. My name is Birgit Pauli-Haack and I&#8217;m your host, curator of the Gutenberg Times and developer advocate for WordPress. It&#8217;s wonderful to have you all here. Happy New Year, welcome, and today&#8217;s show, we will discuss the opportunities and challenges of the layout features for site builders with the experts, the parents, so to speak, mom and dad of the layout features. And I&#8217;m extremely honored to have Isabel Brison, designer, developer, JavaScript engineer and core contributor on the show. Also Andrew Serong, also full-time developer, contributor to the Gutenberg Project, goes by the title Block Mechanic, and also sponsored by Automattic on the Open Source Project. And last but not least, Justin Tadlock, developer advocate, theme and plugin developer, member of the core team and former writer of the WP Tavern, now working for Automattic and prolific educator on the developer blog and Hallway Hangouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll do some proper introduction in just less than a minute. Just a few housekeeping notes. For those of you watching this on the YouTube livestream, use the chat box next to the video player to post your questions. And you can test it by letting us know where you&#8217;re watching from. The same goes for the Zoom place, but there are two places. One is the chat bubble for all your comments and your greetings and thoughts, and then the Q&amp;A section bubbles for your questions that we then answer in a bit. And please be kind, even if you disagree. This is a family-friendly endeavor. So, what&#8217;s the show about? Layout is a fundamental part of block themes. Layout features allow you to define the widths of your post content and the range blocks horizontally, vertically, right, left, and all sides in container blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in terms of block styling, layout is a complex feature because it affects child blocks in ways that go beyond the CSS, cascading style sheets inheritance. It&#8217;s probably part of the complexity that leaves some users a bit confused on how to deal with the various layout features and how to combine sections to a good page layout, and how this all fits into the block theme building process on template parts and the theme JSON. Before we answer your question, what is a container block, and more, allow me to introduce our expert. Then Isabel will give us a demonstration of the various layout features. And by that time, we probably have an array of questions that we can then tackle here as a panel. Isabel, you have been working for Gutenberg Project for a few years now. Lately, you worked together with Andrew on the layout features. What other parts of Gutenberg did you work on before that, and how long have you been at Automattic?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, yeah. Before this, I think the major thing that I worked on before layouts was the navigation block. That was over a year ago now. And a feature that actually didn&#8217;t make it, which was a navigation screen that was meant to replace the classic menu screen. And yeah, that unfortunately got canned. And before that, we had this whole push to try and get bits of block editing in place for classic themes. We also did the Block Widgets Editor, that was another one I worked on. And yeah, I sort of float around and try to tackle accessibility issues when I have a bit of time between the major projects too. That&#8217;s sort of a passion of mine, and there&#8217;s a lot to do in that regard, always.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, always. Yeah, that&#8217;s true. Yeah. Well, where you&#8217;re located and what do you do when you&#8217;re not working?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I am in Sydney, Australia. And oh, I don&#8217;t think I answered the bit of the question about how long I&#8217;ve been at Automattic. I&#8217;ve been at Automattic for, it&#8217;s going to be four years this year. I joined mid-2019. It has been a while, but it feels like it has gone really quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, but in Gutenberg years, it&#8217;s kind of three quarters. No, 80% of the Gutenberg development time, you have been part of it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, it feels weird to think I joined kind of at the start of the thing, when it was already in core, but it hadn&#8217;t been in core for very long and so I&#8217;ve seen it grow and yeah, it kind of feels like my baby now. Like, oh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. What do you do for fun when you&#8217;re not working on a computer, or how you get away from the computer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, all sorts of things. I get away art, gardening. I like to go outside. No actually, you shut the computer down and go outside and get fresh air. I do a lot of gardening. I like growing herbs and veggies. I like going for walks, healthy stuff. And yeah, no, I do a bit of artwork on the side too, those, all sorts of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. Yeah. Well, I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re here. Andrew, what have you been working on in Gutenberg and before you worked on the layout features, and what made you select the title of Block Mechanic?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Ah, that&#8217;s a good question. Yes, I think I started contributing to Gutenberg more actively surrounding how to interact with patterns and block patterns. That kind of quickly led on to contributing to design tools, because to have really great patterns, you need to have a lot of flexibility in design tools. And then I naively picked up what I thought was going to be a really easy issue to implement, of adding gaps between child blocks. And I thought, &#8220;Oh, that won&#8217;t take too long.&#8221; And like a lot of things, the first prototype only took a couple of weeks or whatever to put up, but then very quickly when you start digging into it, it then turns out there&#8217;s a whole load of complexity to wrangle, and that was both exciting and also a really big challenge. And so I figured, &#8220;Oh look, I&#8217;ll just put up my hand and give this a shot.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so then quickly found that there&#8217;s a difference between setting gaps on flex blocks versus things that have flown, and having vertical margins and things. Hopefully, we&#8217;ll get into that on the call, but it sort of led to picking the name Block Mechanic. My job title is officially JavaScript engineer, but engineering often sort of sounds a bit highfalutin or whatever, like you&#8217;re going to do big systems design and everything. But I think a lot of our job really is fixing the nuts and bolts and taking something apart and putting it back together. And so I don&#8217;t really consider myself an expert. I&#8217;m really more a generalist that is very keen to jump in and see if I can help move things forward. I kind of like a pragmatic title like that, personally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent, yeah. And where are you located?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: I&#8217;m also in Australia. Up until a couple of weeks ago, I lived in Melbourne, so Melbourne, Victoria, the second biggest city in Australia, but I just recently moved to the country about an hour and a half away. So, getting adjusted to a different quality of life, but it does make me very much appreciate working remotely because pretty much my whole life has changed, but work is exactly the same, which is really, really very nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, I appreciate that. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Justin, and you have been in the same space for almost as long as WordPress has been in existence. Recently, you switched from writing for WP Tavern to working for Automattic as a full-time contributor. And recently, you wrote a few tutorials on the official WordPress developer blog, and just today, we published your post about the layouts. Yeah, do you want to briefly talk about what you are doing and where you&#8217;re from and what you do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yes. I&#8217;m a developer advocate with Automattic since last May. Now, I don&#8217;t know how to define what I do sometimes. I kind of bounce around, but mostly my goal is to teach, to carry other people along this WordPress journey as best I can. And I&#8217;m glad we have the developer blog up and running, even though it&#8217;s still in beta. I&#8217;m hoping to be a big contributor there and write about layouts and everything else WordPress related. I&#8217;m from Alabama, in the United States, that&#8217;s the Southeast region. And I live not in the city, but a little bit outside of the capital of my state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Are you going to Wordcamp in Birmingham?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Somebody just asked me that today. Not as of right now, but I could be convinced to still go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. Yeah. Yeah, let&#8217;s start at the beginning. I&#8217;m thrilled you all three all agreed to come here and be part of this Q&amp;A. I&#8217;m really sorry, listener and watchers or viewers, yes, I saw that the chat is disabled, but somehow I tried every little button there and I can&#8217;t enable it without probably going into the settings of the webinar and stop it. Yeah, feel free to just put your chat in the Q&amp;A and we kind of sort it out. Sorry about that. All right, so container blocks are group blocks to answer that question, column blocks, button blocks, social link blocks, cover block. Yeah. And now as promised, Isabel, are you ready to start us off with a demo?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;ll share my screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent, yes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Share screens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Share the screen and I&#8217;ll try to figure things out with the chat thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison:</em> Okay. Can you see my screen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: There should be a cat picture on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: There is. That&#8217;s a cute cat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, okay, that&#8217;s the correct screen. Right, so layouts are a feature that came in with site editing pretty much because in classic themes, you used to just the theme also used to just figure out the layout themselves, writing CSS to space blocks and create columns and things like that. But with site editing, we have to provide mechanisms, that is the block editor has to provide mechanisms that allow people to do that layout work themselves. This is what the feature is meant to do and I&#8217;m going to showcase it. If you see my screen, I have actually the post editor open because all of these features that can be used in the site editor can also be used in the post editor. And if you&#8217;re showcasing single blocks, I feel like it&#8217;s easier to showcase them in the post editor because it&#8217;s a simpler interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we have a group block and you can see the outline here. This group, it has got a few blocks inside it. And if you go into the block settings, that&#8217;s actually not selected. So now I&#8217;ve selected my group block, and if you go into the sidebar where the block settings are, you&#8217;ll see that there is a tab called layout. And this has a bunch of controls. In the group block, you basically have two states where you can have the state. This most basic state of layout is it doesn&#8217;t do anything except provide a bit of spacing between each block. So, there&#8217;ll be a bit of a margin between each of the blocks inside the group. And then the further to that, the other, so it&#8217;s actually a different type of layout that you get when you toggle this toggle on is the same, a few spacing between the blocks, but you get content with two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your theme defines a content width, that content width will be applied and the blocks will go no further than that particular width. Here, this is the theme. The theme, this is 2023, I should have said, that I&#8217;m doing the demo on, and the content with &#8230; You can see it in the site editor, if you go into the styles tab and into layout. This is global styles and in layout, here we can see that the default content width for this theme is 650 pixels. That&#8217;s the width that these blocks should be respecting when that content width inside the layout is toggled on. But these, the sort of vanilla and the content width aren&#8217;t the only kinds of layout that we have. And the group block is pretty handy to showcase different types because it actually works with all different types of layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might not realize that at first sight, but group block, roadblock and stack block are essentially all the same block. And you can actually toggle, so if you have a group in this up here at the top in the sidebar, you can actually toggle between the different types of block that group can be, so row, stack and group, and they all have slight differences. So group, as we&#8217;ve seen, deals with the content width, roadblock has a flex layout. And what this means is that all of the elements inside the block will be side by side as long as there&#8217;s space to contain them. You can actually force them to always be side by side even if there&#8217;s not a lot of space. So, you can get the blocks go really, really small and narrow, and all try to fit on the same line. And that is also a layout setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we select the row here and we go and look at the layout tab once more in the sidebar, we&#8217;ll see that these controls are completely different from the group controls. And because it&#8217;s a flex block, we have a bunch of different options where we can justify here. You actually, let me close this. Okay, now we have a bit more space and we can see what these justification options do. With the row, you can justify all the content to the left or to the right or center, or you can add space between the blocks. And if you change the orientation, it becomes a stack block, essentially, because stack blocks are also flex layout blocks, but instead of being laid out horizontally, they&#8217;re laid out vertically. Now the only other control, going back to the row that I haven&#8217;t actually showed, is this toggle that tells you that you can wrap to multiple lines. And what happens if you toggle that on? Actually, do we have the row blocks selected? If we toggle that on, it should do something it&#8217;s not doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: You might need some more content on that line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s what I was thinking. Yes. If you have enough content or there is not enough space, that toggle will enable the content of that row to break into multiple lines, but you don&#8217;t have to do that. If the toggle is turned off by default, and that means that everything in that row is going to sit on the same line forever and there&#8217;s no changing that, even on a phone. Okay, but what can we do with these layouts? It&#8217;s all fine to look at blocks and add random content in them. Let&#8217;s go into the site editor and actually see, in terms of laying out your website, what are the practical effects of these controls? Okay, so here we have, here in the site editor, the list view is super handy for navigating because you tend to have a lot of wrappers. In order to create an elaborate layout, you almost always have to nest groups and rows and stacks inside each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that means that the layout and selecting the blocks can get pretty complicated. So, I do recommend that you use the list view to navigate through all your blocks in the site editor. And it&#8217;s also the most accessible way of block navigation currently. Here we have a header, it has a group in a row, and you have the body which also is wrapped in a group. And actually, let&#8217;s go into the settings because we were in the global site tab. This group block that wraps the whole content has a content with the way layout. And let me just zoom out for a bit, and let&#8217;s make this small so that we actually see, so now this is tiny and you can actually see that there&#8217;s this block of, this is the group block and all its contents is sitting sort of inside in the middle, and it&#8217;s respecting that content width. And what I want to do, maybe I should zoom back in a little bit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to show these justification controls that you can see when you have this group layout and you can choose to justify. By default, your quantity is going to be centered if it has a content width, but using these controls you can push it right to the right or to the left. And what that does is just reposition the whole block of content to one side or the other. And that&#8217;s kind of different from the similar controls that we have in the flex layout because this just repositions the whole block. It&#8217;s not looking at individual child items inside it. And it definitely is not justifying your text, in case you might wonder. If you have a block of content that has text in it and you decide to justify it right or left with these controls, your text is going to stay in exactly the same place, as you can see here. It&#8217;s only the block that&#8217;s going to be moved, the whole block of content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, what else can we look at here in the header? Let&#8217;s go in and see some flex blocks in action. In the header, we have a group that is basically the only thing that this group is doing here is allowing the content width to be defined on its children. In this case, it has a single child, which is a row block. And the row block, what it&#8217;s doing is positioning. It&#8217;s allowing us to position the site title and the navigation on opposite sides of the block. So what we have in the row, we have a space between justification selected. That&#8217;s what it does. It just pushes all the elements inside the row in a way that they will have exactly the same space between them. So, we can see if we add another block in here inside our row, I&#8217;m going to add a site logo because that&#8217;s something that you might also want in the header.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m actually going to push it, these text buttons, so the horizontal move aren&#8217;t doing too well. We need to fix that. Okay, now I&#8217;ve pushed the site logo to the far left, and now I have the site title sort of in the middle and the navigation at the end. But what I really want is for the site logo and the title to be side by side. Now we actually, as of last month, in the plugin, we have a way to do that. And so what we added was the ability to manipulate the size of the children of flex containers. In this case, the row is our flex container and the site title is a direct child of that container. And so in the site title settings, I hope this is not too small to see. If you go in here under dimensions, you have a width control, which may or may not be visible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might have to go into the dimensions menu and actually select it if it&#8217;s not visible. And this width control, I&#8217;ll zoom back in because this is practically invisible. This width control has three options. Fit is the default, it basically does nothing. But if you select fill, then that block is now going to occupy the maximum space it can in its container. And as you might see, that has in fact pushed the site title to sit next to the logo because now it takes up all the remaining space. So, you have that nice space between site title and logo and navigation, which is what we wanted. There&#8217;s also another option in here that you can play with is the fixed width, which allows you to set a fixed width. I don&#8217;t know, I could go 800 pixels, and suddenly this is really big and it doesn&#8217;t fit in a single line, but we don&#8217;t want to do that, do we?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, what else do we have? Oh, there&#8217;s a really, really exciting feature that has just, just been merged. I don&#8217;t think I mentioned this, but what you&#8217;re seeing now, this demo, is the latest Trunk. If you go into the Gutenberg repo and check out Trunk and build a local development environment, this is what you&#8217;re going to see. And only yesterday, a very exciting piece of work was merged that allows us to position blocks. And currently, the only way that we can position them is sticky. But that is actually super useful if you want to create a sticky header. And I&#8217;m going to show how you can do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, due to the way that sticky position works in CSS, we have to make sure that the element that we want to make sticky is inside a container that&#8217;s scrollable. And because of how our template parts work, you&#8217;re not really able to add stars to template parts themselves. If we want to make our header sticky, we actually have to wrap it in a group block. Fortunately, that&#8217;s pretty easy to do because in the header controls, you can just click group and that will wrap our header in a group block, as you can see. And now with the group block, if we scroll straight down &#8230; Oh, wait a minute, I don&#8217;t see the position. Let me reload my site. Is it possible that I&#8217;m not on the latest version of Trunk?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Quite possibly. It was just merged yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Quite possibly. Yes, it was just merged yesterday, but I was pretty sure that I had built it and I was on the latest version of Trunk, but oops. Oops. Where has my demo gone? Yes. Okay, let&#8217;s check that again. I&#8217;ve just reloaded, I need to redo the header. Come on, group and position. Indeed, I had not reloaded the page since I rebuilt Trunk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: There it is, saved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Okay, now the position control has a dropdown, which currently only allows us to select one option apart from default. And that option is sticky. If we select sticky, hopefully now we scroll and as we are scrolling, we see that that header is sticking to the top. Now, this is not super visible because the header&#8217;s background is actually transparent. So, this feels a bit confusing. Let&#8217;s add a bit of background. Let&#8217;s say let&#8217;s just add a little gray background color, and now we can see. Now, that&#8217;s a lot more visible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, this is the new thing that we can do, which is super exciting. Of course, we can position any kind of block, but currently the control only works with group blocks, or groups, rows or stacks, which are essentially all a group block. And we have enabled that in the group block because it&#8217;s a new feature. To start with, this is the most obvious block to do it in. That doesn&#8217;t mean that it might not later be applied to other types of blocks, so that depends on the usage, that depends on the feedback that comes in. It depends on a lot of basically, how are people going to use it? How useful is it going to be? I think it&#8217;s going to be pretty useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Yeah, me too. Probably an interesting thing to mention about position support as well was that when we started working on it, we were thinking of it as just another part of layout. Because we&#8217;re laying out a website, you kind of think, &#8220;Oh, these are all layout tools.&#8221; But through the discussion, we determined that one of the unique things about layout is that it applies to container blocks, so a block that can contain other blocks. And so a lot of the controls are surrounding how do you arrange children of a container? Whereas with position, within, I think one of the designers mentioned, wouldn&#8217;t it be cool to be able to move an image block, like just have it moved to the left slightly or have some sort of asymmetrical layouts? And so that then made us think, &#8220;Oh, well maybe position is actually its own block support, so it has its own panel.&#8221; And so we borrowed a lot of the code from layout and it sort of sits adjacent to the layout. It&#8217;s technically separate from the layout block support, but it still shares a lot of the same code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. Yeah, that is true. I think we&#8217;re pretty much done. I just wanted to show another thing, another little gotcha. Particularly with the recent ability of adding spacing or adding sizing to child blocks of flex, so we saw that in row, in a row block, if you want to create spacing between, if you want to push a block to one place &#8230; Say if I want this block to be next to the first one, and if I want there to be more space here, then I can go in into the dimensions and fiddle with the width of that block. But in stack, which is the vertical equivalent of the flex layout, that won&#8217;t actually work because stack has as its height, it always takes up the content height. Again, this is a reflection of how height works in CSS, whereas usually the maximum width of something is the width of the screen, the height is the height of the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s something that can actually be pretty confusing, especially if you don&#8217;t know CSS. In the stack block, you couldn&#8217;t just go in and select this block in the middle and give it, if you make it fill the available space. Well, the available space is just the space that those blocks occupy, so you can&#8217;t actually push it down. I guess you could give it a fixed height and then that would work. But if you wanted it to just fill the remaining space, your container block would need to have a fixed height. And now, we have that possibility because we can add to container blocks under dimensions, we can add a minimum height to them. And so I could say I want this whole stack block to be 900 pixels, and now I have a bit of extra space and I can choose to maybe make or maybe create a space between the first paragraph of text and the photograph, for instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can play around a bit more, but remember that for stack blocks, if we want to have a bit of extra space in them, then we actually have to give them a defined height. And that is pretty much everything that I wanted to show. So, questions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right, well, wonderful. The privilege of a panelist is that you can have the first questions to demos. So Andrew or Justin, you have a comment or a note or a question for Isabel, go right ahead before we take the audience questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, actually, are we going to see grid layouts at some point, like we have with flex?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: That is a great question. Yes, definitely. And that is something that I would very much like to see done, and will probably be working on sometime this year. Grid is interesting. It is super useful because although pretty much at the moment we are using flex to create two dimensional layouts, and that&#8217;s not quite the right way to use flex. In my mind, flex should be used more for the detail, for small elements and not for whole layouts, because it becomes quite difficult to manipulate it with precision in larger, full-page layouts. And that&#8217;s why we see bits, you have flex in your header, you might not have &#8230; You won&#8217;t have the whole page wrapped in a flex block, but grid is super useful for creating full page layout. The difficulty with grid, the challenge is going to be because grid in CSS, the CSS grid spec is super complex, and there&#8217;s millions of things that you can do with it. So how can this be best translated into a UI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s, I think, and that is one of the biggest challenges in creating design tools for Gutenberg, is exactly that problem of translation of essentially the underlying implementation is CSS, and what is the most useful, what are the most useful controls that we can provide that reflect the abilities and the plasticity of CSS but are a usable and are intuitive to understand? You don&#8217;t want to just grab the whole CSS spec and translate it into UI, because that would be chaos. I mean it would be fun and interesting, but it probably wouldn&#8217;t be very usable. So yeah, that&#8217;s going to be a very interesting challenge to tackle in the coming year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, I figured I&#8217;d just throw the hardest question out to start with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, let me go through the questions and Glenn Martin has been waiting for quite a while to answer his question, and it&#8217;s hopefully an easy one to answer. &#8220;In the site editor, is there a way to create a menu with the images instead of text?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: With images, a menu? Oh, I see. Oh that, interesting. I think, am I still screen sharing? I&#8217;m still screen sharing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, you&#8217;re screen sharing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Let me try something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: On the fly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: In the navigation block we have links. I&#8217;m assuming that what you want to do is to, instead of having the text, have an image link. Because this is rich text, we should be able to add inline images. If I want to add…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: As an aside, I love your image gallery. More cats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: More cats, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, technically you could do that. This is a page list. With the page list, actually, it just gives you a list of all the pages that you have. You can tell this is a test site because the only page I have is a sample page, but we can actually make the page list editable, and that converts it into a bunch of links. And so technically, because this is now a link, we could actually go and do the same and add an inline image. Now, no guarantees how accessible this is going to be because the inline image is fairly limited. You would be able to add a label, a description title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, if I were to do this, I would give it a run through a screen reader just to double-check that your text content in the links is actually being read at, and do add text content because otherwise, screen reader user goes in there and clicks on the image or focuses on the image. And the only thing that&#8217;s read out is the image, either the file name or the URL. So, that will be very confusing. But yeah, I mean technically it is possible to do that now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, that&#8217;s interesting. I have found that the inline menu, even for the paragraph, has a lot of great surprises for me. I was interested to see the inline image available for the block. Now Dana Rogers has this question, so group is just an understanding. &#8220;Group is a block element in row and stack are flex elements?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Mm-hmm. Yeah, essentially. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That was an easy question then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, I was going to say the group block uses the default flow layout of the web, if you want to describe it like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. Yeah, I was taking block to mean as in display block, which yes, that&#8217;s correct. The group displays is block. But yeah, it is a flow layout. It&#8217;s as close to vanilla HTML as you can get in its default state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah and &#8230; Go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: I was just going to say the one thing that&#8217;s in addition to vanilla HTML is that it sets a margin top on everything except for the first child. And that&#8217;s how the gap is controlled between the spacing of each element within that group block. So, it&#8217;s a little bit opinionated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay, yeah. Peter Goodsword, I hope I didn&#8217;t butcher too much your last name, &#8220;Is this a preview version? I don&#8217;t have a header in my list view, neither do I see settings, styles or options in my top right bar, even though everything is selected in my preferences.&#8221; There might be. Did you enable, Isabel, some experiments on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison:</em> I have a setting enabled, which has actually been in there for quite a while. If you go to the top right button and you get a menu and way down, you click preferences, you have this toggle which says show button text labels. The default state of the site editor, you have icons for all the buttons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, no. I think the question was more about in the list view, you have a header item. Yeah. And that should be actually in WordPress, or is that recently in the &#8230; I&#8217;m not quite sure if you don&#8217;t have it. Yeah, this is definitely in the Gutenberg plugin, Peter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: My main question would be, are they in the site editor instead of the post editor?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, this. Oh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That could be, yeah. Yeah. There is the list view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I mean in here, we do have list view in the post editor. And we do have-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But not the header section?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Well, there&#8217;s list view and outline. I mean, what do we mean by header section?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The header, the header template part that you see, the list view. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, the header template part. Yeah. Oh yeah, no. Template parts. I think template parts are specific to the site editor. Let me see. Can I actually…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s to the site editor. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It&#8217;s not. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: No, no, you can&#8217;t actually add a template part in the post editor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Peter, does it make sense to you that it&#8217;s the difference between being in the post editor and site editor to what you see in the list here? Okay, so yeah, that answers that question. Thank you, Peter. It&#8217;s always important to figure out which, yeah, editor we&#8217;re actually looking at. Now M has a question. &#8220;How can you make a header sticky but not take up the entire screen when zoomed in?&#8221; I&#8217;m not quite sure I understand that. Maybe Isabel and Andrew or Justin understand it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: You mean…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: I&#8217;ll let you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Not take up as in if we zoom in. Okay, if we zoom in past some point. Okay. Yeah. How not to have this happen if you have a big header and you&#8217;ll zoom way in? We do not have a…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: If you had a fixed dimension of 900 pixels, how would that work on mobile?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: One of the things that might be useful is when you&#8217;re adjusting settings, if you&#8217;re using minimum height or something like that, when you&#8217;re selecting the unit, you can switch to using viewport relative units. There&#8217;s a VH option. You can set something to be proportional to the height of the viewport. If you&#8217;re setting the height of your header area, that&#8217;s one way to do it. But another thing is if you&#8217;re setting an element to be sticky, it is kind of being mindful of how many blocks you&#8217;re putting into it. When Isabel was zooming in just then, you could see that in the navigation block, it was switching over to using the hamburger menu. That&#8217;s kind of nice so that way, when it goes to those small viewports, it shrinks like that. But at the moment in the initial implementation, we don&#8217;t really have any settings that are doing things differently in desktop versus mobile, or based on the screen width. It&#8217;s sort of up to how much content you are putting into your header to make sure that it plays nicely at different viewport sizes, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. There were a few more questions. Darren Davis has the question, &#8220;Can you have more than one sticky position group on a page?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Yes, you can. Interestingly, because we chose to go with sticky first as opposed to fixed, what sticky does is on the block that you&#8217;ve put, you&#8217;ve set it to be sticky, it will then scroll to the next container up, so just its direct parent. In Isabel&#8217;s example, it&#8217;s at the very root of the document where we&#8217;ve set sticky, so that&#8217;s the entire page. But if you were to go a little bit further within your nesting and set it into quite a nested group area, it would only stick to that particular area that you&#8217;re scrolling past, and it would then scroll off the page. It means that you can have as many sticky elements as you want. Probably a good example would be some websites that might have a glossary that have the alphabet, and as you scroll past each letter, then that letter sticks to the top of the screen before it then scrolls off the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, that&#8217;s pretty cool. Yeah, you can do all kinds of little things. Yeah, yeah, excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: But also, it&#8217;s a new feature. One of the things we&#8217;ll be keen to see with feedback, like when we&#8217;re developing things, I think one of the challenges working in Gutenberg is trying to &#8230; The initial issue might be this really great idea, really fleshed out and then we go, &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the smallest version of that we can implement and code and get it into the plugin and then get some feedback and see what people can build with it?&#8221; If you are playing with it and have some ideas, feel free to open up GitHub issues and discuss what do you think we should do next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And from YouTube we have a question about are you working on &#8230; Oh, we already answered that. &#8220;What happens to my custom additional CSS if moving to the new WordPress block themes?&#8221; And she was just getting used to the recent customizer things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, there&#8217;s actually a ticket. There&#8217;s some of the feedback I left as that we need to &#8230; The additional custom CSS needs to be ported over no matter where you originally set it in the customizer or in the global style section. Yeah, I don&#8217;t think it works like that yet, but I&#8217;m pushing for it. I hope. Yeah, we don&#8217;t want to lose that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, good, good. That answers the question there. And then I think Don Fisher has the next question and it&#8217;s, &#8220;Will there be any breakpoint-specific layout adjustments coming for any of the blocks?&#8221; I think that goes back to that question about intrinsic design versus media query-based design. Andrew, is that a question for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Oh yeah, I&#8217;m happy to talk about it. Yeah, there has been a lot of discussion across a number of different issues about people wanting to put in breakpoints and have that level of control, &#8217;cause they see it in a lot of page builders. But I think probably one of the areas of caution in Gutenberg is that once things wind up in core, we then have to support it in perpetuity. And it&#8217;s very easy for managing breakpoints to become really complex and not quite work properly in patterns. Let&#8217;s say we had something that was having a different layout on mobile versus desktop, but then you put that pattern into a really nested area and then it doesn&#8217;t quite work properly. The idea with intrinsic design is instead of using breakpoints, if we can use viewport-relative units or if we can use calculations or things like that. The recent fluid typography is probably a good example of a feature that doesn&#8217;t use breakpoints, but is kind of relative to the viewport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think probably, &#8217;cause I&#8217;m not a designer, I sort of focus on what are the areas of consensus that we currently have in the GitHub repo, and how can we build to those things while giving designers a little bit more room to explore all the options before we try and commit that in code?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Yeah, thank you. M has another question. &#8220;For any image icon in the nav menu, do you ensure that there&#8217;s alt text?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: As in what I was showing earlier?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All text as in your image context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, your inline images, and please, someone correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, which I don&#8217;t believe that we have a way of adding alt text to inline images. And this is why I was saying, I mean technically it&#8217;s possible to create a navigation with just images, but I would run that through a screen reader first to ensure it&#8217;s accessible because I&#8217;m not 100% sure. If you add a link title, I&#8217;m guessing that that would be the best option to add meaningful text to the image as a link. But yeah, I would definitely double-check that and make sure it&#8217;s accessible because it&#8217;s not guaranteed. I mean, it wasn&#8217;t meant to be used in this way. So, I guess that what I was showcasing is more of a hack because the inline images are more &#8230; The main use case for inline images would be if you wanted to add an icon at the beginning of the text. It wouldn&#8217;t be to replace the text with an image.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is something that we could look into doing. It would be an interesting experiment, to enable a way of creating a navigation with images that was fully accessible. But I think we would need to do a bit of work on that to make sure it is fully accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: I will just say when you&#8217;re actually in the media library, you can add the alt text in the modal overlay that&#8217;s popped up, and it will get inserted into the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, if you add the alt text in the media library, you can actually have it pop up in the inline image?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, yeah. I was just running a test on it real quick.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Nice, okay, then that works, yes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: On image, yeah, nice. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Corner Shop Creative person has a question or two, actually. The first one is, &#8220;Will negative margins be added to Gutenberg? Right now, you don&#8217;t have the ability to add a negative margin to any element, but they are highly useful for achieving some layouts.&#8221; You chuckled there, Andrew.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: That&#8217;s a really good question. I think that I&#8217;ve seen a couple of PRs that have attempted to implement it before, and I think the main issue is that it then makes it really hard to select the blocks in the block editor. It&#8217;d be very easy to accidentally slip a block underneath another block and then be unable to select it. I think it&#8217;s absolutely a great feature, but I don&#8217;t think the UI part of it has been figured out to how do you do that without losing the blocks altogether?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, list view comes really handy in that one. Yeah. And then the second question was, &#8220;Will absolute or relative positioning ever come to Gutenberg?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Yes, that&#8217;s the hope. One of the reasons why sticky position took quite a while to figure out, the issue for it I think was open in 2021, and there were a few different experiments last year, was really figuring out the direction with designers to make sure that the way we&#8217;ve set it up allows us to explore future experiments where we might set a block to relative, and then a block beneath it to absolute, and then be able to move things around in an intuitive way. I think it&#8217;d be a really fun area to experiment with. And we&#8217;ve got sort of the initial foundation in place, so we can probably start doing some experiments this year and see if it&#8217;s one of those easy things or if it&#8217;s one of those gigantic rabbit hole, takes a long time things, which I suspect it might be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Does it answer your question? Corner Shop Creative? Yes. Good, good, good. And then Stefan Mandel has a question and he writes, &#8220;The header and footer are also a kind of container block, so shouldn&#8217;t they have most of the controls of the group block? Is it kind of unintuitive to have that you first have to put the header within a group and then get the sticky functionality?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s one of the things we were discussing before we landed on that initial approach. One of the challenges, that the way that template parts work in the site editor is that they&#8217;re kind of a placeholder for another chunk of post content, of a bunch of blocks. And because it&#8217;s that sort of placeholder, there&#8217;s currently no ability to add styling directly to it. There&#8217;s a few technical reasons why that&#8217;s the case. The interventions we need to work out are how do we get the document to control how position works and then make it intuitive in the UI. I think sticky will probably always still need to be set either on the direct parent or the direct child, that it&#8217;s probably a UI problem to solve as to how to make that intuitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. There were a few questions in the chat that didn&#8217;t come over to the Q&amp;A. One was, &#8220;Will we in the future way to edit the names of the items in the list view?&#8221; There was a PR, but I don&#8217;t think it got merged or had any additional work on. So, we don&#8217;t know. And thank you for Corners Shop Creative to answer that question in the chat. And then the other question was just by Dale again, &#8220;Do all the settings in Gutenberg eventually resolve to CSS?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Oh, that&#8217;s an interesting one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I mean, in all the design settings, all the settings that allow you to manipulate the appearance of your content do eventually resolve to CSS because that&#8217;s the language of visual presentation in web browsers. So yes, I think. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Probably one of the interesting things is where we have a one-to-one relationship between setting and CSS, and where we sort of deviate a bit. Things like marginal padding, the direct to CSS properties of margin and padding are applied, but something like block gap or block spacing, that&#8217;s sort of a concept in WordPress land. And then depending on the layout type, we then interpret that as that&#8217;s either a margin top, or if it&#8217;s a flex block, then that&#8217;s CSS gap.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Is it possible that we ran out of questions? Max Zeable on YouTube has a comment that, &#8220;That is an interesting point, meaning the intrinsic design approach, this should be communicated much more specifically to the page builder people,&#8221; because, so that he wrote, and I totally agree with him. There is not a whole lot of information out there, and I know there is a post in the works about that, but we definitely can use any additional help with that. The, I think, intrinsic design was only come out 2019 or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Yeah, it seems to be quite a recent trend. And I think with a lot of the new newer CSS functions like minmax and calc and things like that, and also the promise of container queries and that sort of thing. But yeah, I think there is a fairly old issue, I&#8217;m not sure where it is right now, maybe someone can find it on discussing intrinsic web design with a bunch of the designers. For anyone interested in that, it might be useful to have a dive in to the Gutenberg repo and join the discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m going to share it in the chat window. Hang on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think that&#8217;s the issue. It&#8217;s called Responsive Blocks Versus Intrinsic Web Design. It seems to be in the title there. And I also saw recently a YouTube video where the person says, &#8220;Okay, it&#8217;s the browser and the media queries can&#8217;t actually cover all the different sizes anymore because there&#8217;s so many different sizes on devices that you always hit the wrong parts.&#8221; So, you could end up with not three viewports, but with 12. And I saw a plugin actually that had six different viewports for which you can create different designs. And I think that is a little bit too much cognitive load for my brain to tackle when I want to build a website. Some people can probably do that, but it&#8217;s definitely not for a user who wants to just publish content and do that. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: And it&#8217;s probably a good point that part of the beauty of plugins is that they can really go in some sort of wild directions and try that out in a way that we probably wouldn&#8217;t really want to do in core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: I would say as a designer, it takes a little bit of getting used to, but I&#8217;ve kind of embraced intrinsic design over the last couple of years. I can&#8217;t remember the last time I&#8217;ve written a media query. Even outside of block-themed development, I want to use fluid values for font sizes, spacing, everything. I think it simplifies how we build for the web. And I also think most of our users, everyday users are going to be on mobile devices. So these really complex layouts where we have horizontal layouts and things are not how most people view the web. It&#8217;s mostly just top-down. And so I think intrinsic design is going to be the direction that&#8217;s best. It takes a little change of mindset and just if you haven&#8217;t moved beyond media queries, definitely try it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: One of the useful things, one of &#8230; Sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I was going to say one of the useful tools for that is CSS Grid because it has a bunch of auto placement features that will just resize and reflow the content depending on the screen size. And it&#8217;s great but yes, I agree with Justin, it does require a change of mindset because essentially what you&#8217;re doing is giving up control. You don&#8217;t get to decide whether your layout has two columns or three. It will be decided based on the size of the content and the size of the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I can see that media queries are important when you want to hide content. Yeah, that&#8217;s not just stacking, but then you say, okay, if it&#8217;s just on mobile, I don&#8217;t want to have these additional columns just go on the bottom of it. I just want to hide them. And I think that functionality is more with the visibility, comes with the visibility of blocks and in core there is no feature right now for controlling visibility of blocks. I think there&#8217;s a great plugin out there that covers quite a bit of the visibility ideas, but it&#8217;s not yet in core. I always hope that it will come into core, but who knows? Corner Creative has one more question, &#8220;Will block guides be added to the Gutenberg block and core example? It&#8217;s hard to know when one block ends and another one begins without borders around the block.&#8221; Any comments on that?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, there has been a lot of design thought on how to best present the block editor. And the thing with the borders is that at some point, it sort of becomes very noisy and the UI can become harder to understand if you have borders around all the blocks. The hope currently is that the list view will do the heavy listing in terms of being able to understand the structure of the page and navigate it more easily. But yeah, that&#8217;s another point where &#8230; I mean yeah, there&#8217;s always going to be discussion around that and I think always going to be striving to sort of an ideal place. But it is a very complex interface and the more features there are and the more things you can do with it, the harder it is to find a UI that&#8217;s easy and intuitive to understand because you have to pack a whole lot of stuff into it. Yeah, that&#8217;s an interesting problem that I don&#8217;t think is going to be ever fully solved to everyone&#8217;s satisfaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Definitely something to keep working on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, and there are plenty of plugins that handle just borders around blocks if you want to search those out. There may even be a browser extension I&#8217;ve seen at one point. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I think the list view has come a long way that when you click on a block in the list view, you get the borders around the block in the canvas or on the, yeah. I think that has come a way. And if it&#8217;s about teaching clients on how to use that, I think that would be the route that I would go. Say, &#8220;Okay, here is your friend, list view is your friend. And you have trouble, go to the list view.&#8221; It&#8217;s kind of that mantra that I would probably implement there to figure out, yeah, teach that, which are the blocks. All right, well we are coming &#8230; We are a little bit over, so I&#8217;m sorry about that, but we covered a lot of ground. Can you briefly, Andrew and Isabel talk about what&#8217;s next in layouts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Oh, great question. I think since we&#8217;ve gotten a lot of foundational work, the main thing is jumping into a lot of these experiments. So like Isabel was saying before, trying out how might a grid layout work, or some of those other ideas for position support. I think probably there&#8217;s a lot of experimenting before we get to things that seem stable enough to put into the plugin. I think probably be diving into a lot of that after 6.2 comes out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, yeah, stabilizing the layout feature also so that extenders can use it. And that will be my number one priority at the moment. And adding layout to a few blocks that don&#8217;t have it yet, such as cover. And then there&#8217;s the bigger features such as grid, for instance, layout, maybe other types of layouts. We&#8217;ll see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, I just look forward to teaching all the stuff that y&#8217;all are working on. Teaching other people. Birgit, you&#8217;re muted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: On mute. Last thing I wanted to share with a group is also the post that Justin just published on the developer blog, and it&#8217;s a walkthrough on the layout classes that came with WordPress 6.1. I think it&#8217;s a really a good post to slow walk you through all the things that you can do. Well, one last question, sorry about that. “Will it be possible to limit the use of some blocks based on user role?” Yes, is the short answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Most likely plugin territory, right? Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And there are some capabilities where you, for instance, the custom CSS, you actually need to have the file editing privileges on your website to actually use that, before that too. So, not every user is able to do custom CSS, for instance, and then the block-locking features there can be attributed to in any role on the site. I think that&#8217;s…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, there&#8217;s great documentation on just locking down things per role in the &#8230; It&#8217;s a document on Curating the Editor and the Block Editor Handbook. I don&#8217;t know the link offhand, but I think there should be an actual user role or something related to permissions setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I just shared the link in the chat, and I will also share that in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right, I think we&#8217;re &#8230; Yeah, it&#8217;s all right. Okay. Well, this was a great show and thank you very much for being here. It was very interesting and I learned so much from you all. Thank you. If people want to get in contact with you, just let us know how that would be possible for Andrew, Isabel and Justin. Andrew, do you want to start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Oh yeah, I&#8217;ll probably say, yeah, open up an issue on the GitHub repo and feel free to ping any of us. There&#8217;s also the label feature layout, which is a good way to make sure that anything related to layout is seen by any of us, so it&#8217;s probably a good way to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, GitHub is a good place. I am Tell The Machines on GitHub. I don&#8217;t use my real name, but you can also find me in the make core Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay, cool. Cool. Justin?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, Twitter, just JustinTadlock, or GitHub too, or Green Shady on WP Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. And if you have more questions, those who are in attendance today will get an email tomorrow with a link to a survey. Tell us how you found it and what other topics you would like to see. And well, I want to just say thank you all for coming and have these great questions. It has been a privilege to have the panelists and the audience here, and we will have two more live Q&amp;As to come. One is about the design system that comes from Figma, bridge to the theme Jason automatically created out of our design system. And the other one is using Gutenberg as a framework to create plugins that are not using the block editor, but using the block editor components and the scripts to build their own app in WordPress and outside. All right, that is it. Thank you all for coming and be well. Talk to you later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Thank you, bye-bye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Bye-bye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Bye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Bye.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 05 Feb 2023 10:39:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Birgit Pauli-Haack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"Gutenberg Times: Gutenberg Changelog #79 – WordPress 6.2, Gutenberg plugin versions 15.0 and 15.1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?post_type=podcast&p=23356\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:112:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-79-wordpress-6-2-gutenberg-plugin-versions-15-0-and-15-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65281:\"<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack and Nick Diego discuss the high-priority items for WordPress 6.2, and the releases of the latest Gutenberg plugin versions 15.0 and 15.1. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-69-gutenberg-releases-wordpress-6-0-1-the-create-block-theme/#shownotes\">Show Notes</a> / <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-69-gutenberg-releases-wordpress-6-0-1-the-create-block-theme/#transcript\">Transcript</a></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Music:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/xirclebox\">Homer Gaines</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Editor:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandy-reed/\">Sandy Reed</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Logo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://markuraine.com/\">Mark Uraine</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Production:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://icodeforapurpose.com\">Birgit Pauli-Haack</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-larger-font-size\"></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nick Diego</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>developer advocate at WP Engine, plugin developer and themes builder.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 15.0, 15.1, as well as the upcoming major release of WordPress 6.2 and a little bit more. Not much more. Special guest today is Nick Diego, developer advocate at WP Engine, Block Editor Triage Squad, and On the Block Editor Triage Squad for WordPress 6.2. I am your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Good Work Times and full-time core contributor for the WordPress Opensource Project, sponsored by Automattic. Howdy, howdy, Nick. How are you doing? Thanks for joining me today as a co-host on the show, as it&#8217;s always a treat to geek out over Gutenberg with you. So how are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I&#8217;m doing great. Thank you so much for having me back on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh yeah, it&#8217;s great pleasure. Yeah, thanks for coming back on. So we have a great show for you dear listeners, as mentioned, but we will take the WordPress 6.2 section at the beginning, so you all are up-to-date on that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>WordPress 6.2</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hector Prieto published the WordPress 6.2 planning roundup with the schedule and the squad, and that has pretty much followed the earlier proposal. We talked about the schedule is Beta 1, scheduled for February 7th. That&#8217;s coming up fast, 2023. The release Candidate 1 will escape into the world on March 7th, that&#8217;s a month later. And the final release is scheduled for March 28th, 2023. Release Candidate 1 is also the time when the developer notes will be published, so they come out at the beginning of March.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The squad release lead is Matt Mullenweg. There are two release coordinators with Francesca Marano and Hector Prieto. So glad that Francesca is back in the saddle of coordinating with Core. Core tech leads are Tanya Morgan and John Baptiste Audras, and the editor tech colleagues are George Mamadashvili and Nik Tsekouras. I think I got this right. Core triage co-leads, Colin Stewart and Mukesh Panchal, and then editor co-leads, as mentioned, Nick Diego and Anne McCarthy. Design lead is Rich Tabor and Documentation co-leads, now we are a group of four with Femy Praseet, Milana Cap, and Apha Thakor. And then there are marketing community co-leads with Jonathan Patani, Lauren Stein and Mary Baum. Test co-leads are Robin Nasmore Hasan, and Adel Tahri. This time new on the WordPress, the release squad is a performance lead, and the first one is Felix Arntz from the performance team. So yeah. Nick, how are you doing with being on the editor triage co-leads?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Oh, it&#8217;s been fun. So first this role was new in WordPress 6.0 and then we continued it for 6.1 and now 6.2 and I think we have a bit more method to the madness now. Things are a bit more organized, think we&#8217;re the most organized we&#8217;ve ever been before beta one has even come out. So I&#8217;m feeling pretty good right now as we head towards 6.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, so what does it exactly entail? If people don&#8217;t know what a triage co-lead is, what do you do there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: It&#8217;s mainly organization, so there&#8217;s a lot of issues and PRs that need to get included in 6.2. We do our best to make sure that any issue or feature that&#8217;s related to 6.2 appropriately has eyes on it, is appropriately getting handled and done. And we also are responsible for helping determine whether an issue maybe is important but maybe isn&#8217;t a blocker to the release, so maybe that can get moved to the next version of Gutenberg or the next 6.3. So it&#8217;s kind of managing all the pieces that are coming together at the end as we head into the final release. We also work with the editor tech co-leads on Backport. So once we get past beta, any new feature will need to get backed into the release and so we help handle that. So it&#8217;s really kind of a bit like an organizational role to make sure that the release goes as smoothly as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s awesome. Yeah, I know that&#8217;s definitely worth having and you do awesome work. It&#8217;s also kind of managing some of the personalities at some point and also kind of what gets priority or not. It&#8217;s really interesting. Thanks for doing it. Again, it&#8217;s the third time that you are on the editor triage leads, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, it is. And thank you for all the documentation work that you guys do, so it&#8217;s a lot of people in the process and to make the release go as smoothly as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I can only repeat what you said. Thereafter, the first two, we all are kind of getting really organized on documentation. We now have, as a new feature, no, not feature, a person on the release team. We also have end user documentation person, Femy Praseet on the release squad. She can also be part of the release team and organize themselves pretty easily. And she gets all the information because that really wasn&#8217;t happening before and there was always, yeah, what is unnecessary for end user documentation versus developer notes and they&#8217;re still behind with end user documentation. They&#8217;re still working on 6.1, but knowing, okay, this is coming into 6.2 and getting the issues done. I also know that both the organization from Milana and Femy, the documentation team has increased in contributors and many of those are actually working on end user documentation. So I&#8217;m really glad that we have that now on the WordPress release team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. And the documentation page on the website got a new redesign recently, which looks very cool. So if you haven&#8217;t seen that yet, go check out the documentation page on wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, is it live now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I believe it is, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay, cool, cool, cool. Because yeah, we have been waiting for on the developer blog, designed to actually follow the documentation design, so we&#8217;ll see how that&#8217;s going to work because the developer news blog is still out in beta. We haven&#8217;t officially released it, so we hope to get to that point quickly. Hopefully before WordCamp in Asia. Are you going to WordCamp in Asia?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I am not, unfortunately. I&#8217;ll be jealous of everybody else who gets to go, but no, not this time unfortunately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. All right. So yeah, with the Gutenberg plugins released, we talk quite a bit on the Gutenberg podcast about all the new features that come in. So I wanted, but still go over the high priority items that are in that one issue that Anne keeps updating and McCarthy keeps updating in the status of it. There are quite a few improvements or massive improvements and new features coming in with 6.2. So I think it can&#8217;t hurt if we look at those high visible items or important items together. They&#8217;re all cataloged by features. So it starts out with patterns and there are two things that come in. One is the pattern inserter next, that means inserter is starting with a list of categories for core as well as the third-party categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, with a click on the category, a panel opens with the patterns for that particular category in a thumbnail view. And I really like that. So you have to kind of, it makes necessary that the categories are very well defined, but it also kind of keeps the focus of the creator, the content creator on what they actually want to do and not distracted on all the other cool patterns. So that is definitely, and that has been in the Gutenberg plugin since the Gutenberg 14.4 release, so it should been quite refined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. And I think it&#8217;s one of those things where it may seem minor to folks, but once you start using it, it&#8217;s like, wow, this is so much better than what it was before. I think it was a dropdown menu where you can select the different categories. So it&#8217;s great to see. And one of the other things that is included with patterns is kind of a re-envisioning of query patterns. So query loop patterns for end users specifically are not really familiar with the term query. It&#8217;s kind of a foreign term if you&#8217;re not deeply entrenched in WordPress. And so, that&#8217;s been changed to be posts, so it displays post summaries in lists or grids and other layouts. So I think it&#8217;s a little bit more user-friendly, and there was also some work to make sure that category descriptions are part of the rest API, which just make the pattern panel a little bit more interactive, a little bit more intuitive. So really great to see the direction that this went and hopefully will just make inserting patterns using patterns more usable for folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and it&#8217;s definitely also for when you have patterns for your plugins or something like that, you can add a description. It&#8217;s so much better than just have a title there to help the user figure out what they&#8217;re going to do with it. So there are six major items for the global styles. One is the way to document containing all blocks and styles. That&#8217;s the so-called style book, and that is really cool. We talked about it on the podcast before of course, but I really like that you can now see all the blocks that you use and that are in the theme in one overview, and also the third-party blocks. So if you make a change in the style editor in the global styles, you can see what the implication would be, especially for the blocks that you not use so often, but when you make a change, you can see the ramifications there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also when you make a change and you would think that it would go to another block because it uses the same block in a cover block or something like that, you see those things as well and are not surprised. Yeah, that has been missing for quite a while. I remember when I started at the agency, when we were starting with using blocks for post content, that we were always kind of trying to figure out, okay, does this seem style all the blocks well enough with the display? So we had one post that every single block was in there with different variations and then had to install it or copy paste it over to the sites to do unit testing. And that, of course, goes away now. And now we also have the third party blocks to view them in the Style book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. It works really well. And to your point, I think a lot of folks were building out default pages with every block on it or multiple pages to try and do those testing and this just makes it so much easier. Kind of going hand in hand with that, there was also some improvement to when you edit block settings in global styles, they&#8217;ll now generate a little preview, which is handy. So before you edit the block, and let&#8217;s say that the block wasn&#8217;t actually on the page you were on in the site editor, now it will give you a little preview so you can see what you&#8217;re actually changing, which coupled with the style book really helps you get a better understanding of what you&#8217;re changing, how it&#8217;s changing, and how it&#8217;s going to affect your site. So those two together I think really help refine the global styles interface. And there&#8217;s still improvements to come, so a lot of good stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes, and one of the other improvements that is coming with 6.2 is that you actually, and that goes hand in hand with the other two, is that you can now copy the style variations for block types. So if you added a style variation, there is a button block that is rounded, but you also want to change the background and then every button block should, with a rounded variation, should follow that design. You can make that happen by pushing that to the global block styles and have a style variation update on that as well. Yeah, it&#8217;s getting really, really sophisticated in terms of what you can manage as a site editor or site user, a site owner in terms of styling and being very deliberate in, okay, this my overall style and this is just for this post, and make sure that those were a tier two in a kind of quasi design system for the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, and I think that you kind of look at it in two ways, and we&#8217;ll talk about this later in this episode, the create block theme plugin, but you have the global styles. So if you&#8217;re the owner of a website and you want to make changes to your site, that&#8217;s great for you. But I&#8217;ve also loved using the site editor to build themes, to build themes for yourself or clients or whatever. It&#8217;s a great building platform. And these tools that allow you to design a block style and then push it globally really speed up that development process when you&#8217;re building out a theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you can use something like the create block theme plugin, which we&#8217;ll talk about later again, where you can just export that as a complete package. And on top of that, one of the things that we&#8217;ve heard a lot about is, if you remember the customizer had an option where you could add custom CSS, right inside of the customizer, and I think people use that a lot for quick fixes or small little CSS snippets that you would want that you wouldn&#8217;t want to have to put into the style sheet of the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that&#8217;s actually coming now to Global Styles as well. There&#8217;ll be an input now for custom CSS that you can apply directly within the Global Styles panel to your theme, and there&#8217;s now going to be per block custom CSS as well, which is really cool. So if you want custom CSS specifically for a specific block, you can do that too. So, so many cool enhancements to global styles that really allow you, whether you&#8217;re an end user and you&#8217;re just managing your own site or you&#8217;re building block-based themes for others, so many cool features that really increase the power of the site editor in global styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, especially the custom styles. Custom CSS was a feature that kept also developers or theme developers to not adopt that much on block themes, but with that little feature to be very much in control of little fixes that don&#8217;t have to go back to the theme JSON and wherever for that one. That is really powerful. And yeah, it will come in, I think it came in with 15.1 to the Gutenberg, no, it came into 14.8, but it was refined later on. You don&#8217;t find it in the left menu, it will be in the styles menu. So it&#8217;s a little bit further away than before, but I think it&#8217;s also more focused to what it actually does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, you&#8217;re not getting distracted when you don&#8217;t use it. So for the editor, there is one information that the documentation information and the outline of the list view is now together. So the information about how many words or how much time to read is now in the list view panel in a separate tab, and just recently it was actually changed that it comes from the bottom is again up on top so it&#8217;s not covered by the view post when you save it. And it&#8217;s a very nice design that came in now with, I think, 15.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, and we are starting to see, and we&#8217;ll see this more as we talk, but a more tab based design within the interface. So instead of having an icon that you click on to get that information, it&#8217;s now kind of part of the insertion tab and it goes hand in hand with some of the other things that we&#8217;ve seen, one of them being a new media tab. So when you go to insert blocks and patterns, you&#8217;ll now have a media tab where you can have direct access to your media library, which is really cool. It just kind of speeds up that flow. You can of course always add image block and then navigate to your media library and do the same thing, but this really just makes it a lot easier to add media to a page, which is neat. And then, oh sorry, go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No, no, sorry. Yeah, the media tab is really helpful, especially when you just want to reuse some of the media that you just uploaded. Yeah, it kind of gives you direct access to it without having to have that modal come up. But what it also does is that gives you a basic open verse integration that is now available. So you can search the open verse. Open verse is the Creative Comments image library that is available at wordpress.org/openverse, and so you see images that are free to use on a website. And Steve Burge, actually, he reviewed the feature through the Gutenberg plugin before it even was out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we put the link in the show note, he wrote about it, about the open verse integration, and it&#8217;s so much easier to handle when you&#8217;re looking for pictures and you don&#8217;t have to go out on a new website. You don&#8217;t have to go out to the new place for your image and download it. It&#8217;s right there. You can access it. It will link to the open verse CDN, but there is a button in the image block where you can say download to media library so you have it again next time when you use it, when I use it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: And it&#8217;s such a cool thing and especially as open verse continues to grow, a good resource there. One other thing in regards to the editor that was introduced was it&#8217;s really kind of hard for a user to differentiate between just a static lock and those that are what we call sync, so template parts and reusable blocks. So while this is not the be all, end all solution, one thing that was added was to colorize synced blocks. Again, temple parts are your reusable blocks. So at first glance, it&#8217;s just easier to differentiate, oh, I&#8217;m editing something that impacts that could change things elsewhere on the site. So those synced blocks are now purple. So if you see purple when 6.2 comes out, that&#8217;s what that means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Yeah, reusable block have the same content everywhere, and when you change them, it will be changed everywhere, and template parts, it&#8217;s just the styling of things. But yeah, it&#8217;s really interesting how different modals and how they&#8217;re so similar but then have a total different impact when you change it on your site. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely worth going over the user documentation for that to just get it really figured out for your daily routine. Yeah. Another feedback was from the full site editing outreach program was that the people have a hard time between what are they editing and what are they looking at, and it now is now introduced in a browse mode that gives you, you can go through all your templates but not add anything. You have to click edit so you know that you are working on that particular template part. Before, when you clicked on the appearance site editor, you jump in right into your homepage for editing and that was kind of confusing because you that might not be what you wanted to edit, and it was also confusing that it only changed on the homepage but not everywhere else when you were doing something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are some really good quality of life, so to speak, changes in 6.2 as well, but also to make the workflow a little bit more intuitive, a little bit more separated kind of separation of concerns. So the user is absolutely clear what they&#8217;re doing in terms of editing or viewing or adding. So there are a few changes that come through the tools section. That one is that the group block now has a setup state, so you can pick the variant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up until now, you&#8217;ve selected the group block, and then on the right hand side in the sidebar, you selected if it&#8217;s a row, a default, or a stacked block, and now you can do this right when you add it to your canvas, which is pretty cool. With it comes the feature to set a width for the blocks in a row. That means that you can really say, okay, these have the same distance, or you need to fill it up with the whole wording or something like that. It definitely helps controlling that. And there&#8217;s also one, you mentioned that in 15.1 that there&#8217;s now minimum height for the stack block group block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, yeah. Minimum height seems like an innocuous change, but it is incredibly useful in various designs. And what we&#8217;re seeing in 6.2 is a lot of improvements to tools that we&#8217;ve had for a long time. So the stack block in particular has been one that it&#8217;s hard for people who don&#8217;t understand, who aren&#8217;t familiar with flex layouts, it&#8217;s like, well, what is this thing? Isn&#8217;t it kind of similar to just a group? It just vertically presents my content, right? Well, it&#8217;s actually much more tricky than that, but we&#8217;ve been missing some of the tools within the UI that allow you to do some cool things with stacks and rows. So, we&#8217;re at a point now with 15.1 and soon to be 6.2, WordPress 6.2, where we have a lot of these tools in the UI. And another one of those tools is fixed position or sticky position because one of the things that people have wanted a lot is the ability to have a header, which you see on a lot of websites, that sticks to the top of the browser window as you scroll down the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this has been introduced in 15.0 where you can now set the position on blocks to be sticky. Now, this is an initial implementation of sticky and position in general. It&#8217;s going to be iterated on for 6.2. You will only be allowed to apply sticky to blocks that are at the root of the page. So that would be things like sticky headers, mainly because there&#8217;s some UX concern. People understanding how sticky&#8217;s kind of a complicated CSS property. So making sure that it&#8217;s really clear to folks when they apply sticky, how it&#8217;s going to impact the page. So there&#8217;s some UX issues there in terms of expanding sticky and other positioning elements throughout the interface, but this is a good first step and it does allow for sticky headers and footers, which is awesome. So a lot of fun things to play with for theme developers specifically that can reduce the amount of custom CSS you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I know we all talked quite a bit about the sticky headers, but I also find sticky footers even more important because that&#8217;s where my thumb is when I look at the mobile version of a website. So don&#8217;t discount the sticky photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Absolutely. Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And yeah, that could be next pages navigation or new features or get totally out of the website with something else, but that can be all done from the footer. Yeah, there were some updates on the blocks as well that are coming to 6.2. There are many, many more, but as I said, these are all the priority items. These are the things that are worked on to actually come to 6.2 period. And one of them is that they fixed the layout jumps selecting an image. That was actually very early in the release cycle in 14.4 plugin release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, and the second one is also the split block toolbar in the sidebar, what you mentioned that there&#8217;s more tabbing going on. The team separated the settings from the appearance in the block sidebar and it was completed in 14.7 and there are certainly some updates later on. And I don&#8217;t know exactly, I have this question since I saw it, and I have not researched it. But do you know if there&#8217;s a way for third-party developers to decide where their settings are going or is that still all coming into settings?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: So yes, I was a big part of making sure that that was possible. Well, I didn&#8217;t do it, but I was advocating for that because one of the good examples is color. Color is clearly an appearance type thing style, but a lot of third-party plugins, or even some core plugins, register their own color pickers. So because that&#8217;s not generated by block support, it&#8217;s a custom implementation, it would by default land in settings. So there would need to be a way to move your custom color panel to styles, especially for user experience because someone&#8217;s, okay, we now have the style tab, wait, colors in settings? So that has been done. So there&#8217;s now a way to define a group on your panels. So if you can say group style and it will end up in the style panel, if you say group setting, it will end up in the settings panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, if you don&#8217;t define a group, and this is something that we&#8217;ll need to put together in a dev note and especially for the field guide for 6.2, if you don&#8217;t define a group, it&#8217;s going to default to settings just because WordPress doesn&#8217;t know what it is. But you can easily update your third-party block or whatever to define what side you want to be on, which is fantastic. I think the tab situation is really good for user experience because I think we&#8217;ve all seen sidebars that you got to scroll forever to see all the different functionality there. So separating that into styles and settings is great. We just now need to make sure that third-party folks can put stuff where they want it and we have the documentation on showing how to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah, I think the next step for the sidebar would be that a user can actually move things around. So yeah, if you want to, but that is, well, a girl can dream, right? And then there is a change or an update and make it easy to copy and paste block styles. So when you have two paragraphs and you change the first one, the styling, like the background of the color, you can say there&#8217;s another menu item in the ellipse menu on the block where say copy styles and then you can go to the next paragraph and you can then paste the style with the same menu item. And that is definitely very powerful. We had reuse of the styles when you create buttons, a row of buttons. Every time you had them styles and then you add a new button, it took over the style from the previous button. That was automatically done, but we didn&#8217;t have that for the single blocks, like for instance, a paragraph block. So this is definitely quite powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. And I want to stress here that when you are copying and pasting styles, what it&#8217;s doing is it&#8217;s copying and pasting styles provided by block supports. So things like dimensions and color, things that are when a block opts into native block supports. So I think that as we move forward, third-party blocks have an incentive to opt into native WordPress controls more than ever, because one, when you opt into native WordPress controls, it&#8217;s very easy. You get all those controls there for you with a single line of code. And two, now we have some additional functionality like copy and paste that supports those native block supports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think this is a very subtle change, but it is really going to start helping hopefully standardize third-party blocks to use core block supports as much as possible, which in the end really improves that user experience. Because if you&#8217;re a new user to WordPress, you just learned how to apply dimension controls or order or whatever, and then you go to a third-party block that doesn&#8217;t have those controls or has a complete custom set of controls, it&#8217;s quite jarring. So I think little changes like this will start incentivizing third-party block developers to standardize around core block supports, which in the end will just improve WordPress across the board. So very excited for this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s great. Very good point. And there are quite a few plugin developers that now, amongst you, that provide additional functionality for it. And if they get additional features that they can use that are maintained by core committers, instead of themselves, it definitely makes the updates easier to propagate. And in the list of 6.2 high priority items, the last one is providing a pathway to migrate widgets to block themes. So what that means is if you are using a classic theme and you switch over to a block theme, it will make it available for you to have the same widgets can now be added to a footer or to a sidebar that&#8217;s in the block theme and you don&#8217;t have to recreate them again as you had to do before. So this is always also a good pathway for adoption of block themes when the migration from a classic theme to a block theme is a little bit easier now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, this is a great thing. I mean, it&#8217;s just one step to make that transition process easier, which we all know it&#8217;s not seamless. I mean, it takes some work to go from classic to block based, but this goes a long way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I see sometimes some questions on Twitter and other places where, how do I convert my classic theme to a block theme? And I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s really possible. I think because they both have so different paradigms to think of, what is the same is the template hierarchy, but I think the block-based approach is so much richer feature set for the user that it&#8217;s not possible to do this one to one transition. There are certainly ways to do that in particular parts. So you could have template parts that are block based on your classic theme, or here, like the migrate the widgets over to block themes, but there is not a one-to-one translation possible because of the different based architecture and paradigms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right, so these were the major points of 6.2. I know there are many, many other smaller changes or that came across without being the high priority, but they&#8217;re still very helpful for 6.2.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I wanted to point out some community contributions and then we get into the release of Gutenberg 15.0 and 15.1. And so, I wanted to point out the advanced query loop plugin by Ryan Welcher. He adds variations for that post loop that we talked about. He calls it a query loop because that&#8217;s what he builds his variation on, but also for date filtering, you can now also, if you use that plugin, you can also have pages that are just per author or for custom post types or custom fields. So he has really expanded that query loop or the post loop in the block editor, so you get a lot of variety and variations that you can use for the more expanded block themes. Because those are still the idea out there that it&#8217;s for simple websites, block themes are good, but not for complex ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is definitely helping. This advanced query loop plugin is definitely helping expanding that. You can certainly learn more about it as he builds out his Ryan live streams, all his work live on Twitch every Thursday from 10:30 PM Eastern AM, PM right? No, I&#8217;m sorry. He live streams his work live on Twitch every Thursday, 10:30 AM, and then after a week or so he also updates the recording to YouTube and that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find his work on the advanced query loop plugin. And of course. We share those all in the show notes. Well, if you ping him on Slack or on Twitter or on his Discord, you can certainly also make requests to what to show in the Twitch stream. So this is really cool. Yeah, Ryan has done this now for a year and he has quite the following on there, but it&#8217;s definitely hands-on programming with blocks and plugins and additional custom fields. There&#8217;s quite a variety there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: And it&#8217;s a fantastic resource for learning, especially for folks who want to build very advanced things. Whether you&#8217;re going to use his plugin, advanced query loop, or not, watching him build it will give you tons of resources and tools to build your own custom blocks. It shows how sophisticated block-based development can be. It&#8217;s not just your simple paragraph block and image. I mean, you can do some really powerful things with blocks and create some really sophisticated interfaces for users. So even if you don&#8217;t need advanced query loop, check out his stream because you&#8217;ll learn a lot of good tips and tricks on how to build your own custom stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haac</em>k: Yeah, and for me, what&#8217;s also a good value is when I watch Ryan do his work, sometimes he runs into something where he says, I didn&#8217;t know where to do that, or there was a mistake and just his workflow on how to debug things and where to look up things. Yeah, it&#8217;s such helpful to watch for your own research and how to handle all the difference, be it the console on the browser or be it the arrow debug log or all the tools that you have. He uses them and he uses them as an expert, but also, when he starts out with something and said, how does this work? Or why doesn&#8217;t it work? It&#8217;s definitely good. Yeah, it also helps me with my imposter syndrome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. We all make mistakes, we all make mistakes, and he does a good job showing you how to dig out from them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: If we all make mistakes, what happens next is the clue for fixing it. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I mean, half of development is Googling things, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. Yeah. And there&#8217;s another plugin, and you mentioned it before, Nick, when we were going through the 6.2 thing was the create theme plugin. And that is created by developers from WordPress and as a tool for theme developers that are not touching code. So you could export a current block theme with the changes you made in templates, template parts, and global styles. That&#8217;s so powerful. And it also has other features. You can create a new child theme from the activated theme and then the activated theme becomes the parent theme. You can also create a completely new theme cloning the activated theme, and the result theme has all the assets of the activated theme and all the user changes. So that is also quite powerful and it saves the user changes as theme changes and deletes the user changes. So they&#8217;re saved in the theme in the folder and the theme JSON is updated and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could also use that plugin to actually create an empty theme, which sometimes you want to just start out fresh. And just recently there&#8217;s a new feature that came in that&#8217;s saves your user changes as a style variation. Remember, the 2023 theme was built with community support on the style variations. They had 38 submissions of style variations and then 10 of those came into theme 2023. But now you can actually create those style variations with the site editor and have your own personal theme 2023 style variation. So Daisy Olsen has started also a weekly live stream on Twitch and for Friday 10:30.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And she has been demoing how to use it and all she talks about is block themes, but also how to then use all the tools that are available. She posts also her recordings on YouTube. I know that Twitch removes videos after 14 days, so all the Twitch streamers are moving recordings over to YouTube when it&#8217;s appropriate. So those are two plugins that you definitely want to check out when you are new to two block themes. But Nick, you also have some great plugins in the repository. And do you have an update on them? I know it&#8217;s the block visibility plugin. What does that do? And then the icon block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, so I built block visibility thinking a year and a half ago now as a way to teach myself some of these new techniques. How do blocks work? I taught myself React to build this block, to build this plugin. And the plugin does something very simple. It was something that I used to have in classic WordPress where you could show, or dynamically show or hide content. Usually you do that with a short code or something like that. I was very popular with widgets. There were tons of plugins that would allow you to only show this widget on pages with certain categories or whatever. And so, in a block-based world where everything on a website is a block, well you then have a consistent type of content that if you can interact with it, if you can do something for a block, then you can basically dynamically show any part of your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s where the genesis of block visibility came about as my own fun little project. It&#8217;s grown considerably. It&#8217;s now at 8,000 active users, which kind of surprises me. And the interesting thing about it is not really the plugin itself, but more so that I am personally anecdotally starting to see a decent uptick in people activating and using block plugins. The icon block is super simple. It&#8217;s literally a way to show SVG icons in a block format. And I tried to build it in a way that is as close to core as possible. It&#8217;s functionality that probably would never be in core because working with SVGs is not really something probably core wants to deal with, but it uses as many block supports as possible, which I try to make it as much like core as possible just for a fun side project. That also just reached 8,000 active users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if people are looking to build plugins, I&#8217;ve historically been a plugins developer. I have built themes before, but I like building plugins more. I&#8217;ve built widgets, I&#8217;ve built short codes, I&#8217;ve built all sorts of different plugins. But building blocks is really fun. And we now have tools like the Create Block Package that I know Ryan has put a lot of time and effort into supporting. It&#8217;s so much easier to build with blocks now than it used to be. And if you&#8217;re kind of on the fence about building custom blocks, I encourage you to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One, there&#8217;s seemingly the market for them, and two, it&#8217;s such a fun ecosystem to play in. So I really enjoyed my two plugins. They&#8217;re doing quite well, which I&#8217;m proud of and thankful to the community for supporting. And I think that we really need, in this new block-based world, we need a rich ecosystem of third-party plugins to do niche functionality that core might not support. So I&#8217;m the biggest champion of folks building custom blocks, whether they&#8217;re on the repo or for yourself. And if you need help, let Ryan or myself know and we&#8217;ll help you with it. But yeah, start building blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, thank you so much. And also to kind of just trail blaze a little bit more, you were ahead of the curve there as well. And how did that turn out? Yeah, I think the last time you were on the show, we were talking about your build a block in 15 minutes talk for WordCamp US, and it was quite interesting to see. I was in the show and yeah, what were the comments afterwards? Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Tons of positive feedback. I think that, and honestly, more of that kind of thing we need to do. I know that there&#8217;s a lot of folks who build websites for clients and they&#8217;re on time constraints. They don&#8217;t have time necessarily to completely learn something new. Whatever it might be is maybe holding them back from working with blocks. Maybe they don&#8217;t even need to work with blocks because their workflow doesn&#8217;t require it. That being said, I think there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity, especially after 6.2. I think back to this time last year where WordPress was. We have introduced so much functionality. It&#8217;s so much easier to build a block theme. It&#8217;s so much easier to build a custom block. I look at 2023 as the age of maturity for block-based WordPress. I mean, we&#8217;re at a point now where you can do so much and build so many sophisticated interfaces. And I&#8217;m starting to see more and more people picking up blocks, exploring blocks. So yeah, it&#8217;s an exciting time to be in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And thank you for being such an advocate for block development and all that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gutenberg 15.0</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that brings us to the Gutenberg plugin releases. We have two to cover. The main things we already kind of talked about in the 6.2 thing, but the Gutenberg 15.0 was released on January 18th. It had 109 merch PRs by 42 contributors. Seven of them were first time contributors. Yay, first time contributors, congratulations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had a few enhancements. One was allowing the resource of the sidebar frame for the side editor. So the side editor has on the left hand side the menu where template parts and templates and other things, forgot what it was. There are more menus there. And now you can change the frame, the space that the sidebar takes from your canvas, which is really cool. You never had that before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. Also, if you slide it all the way, you can also see what the site looks like in mobile view, because it also resizes the site editor itself. So that&#8217;s a really cool one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it does it only in browse mode. When you click on the edit button, the blue edit button, you kind of get the full editor again, full screen editor, but that&#8217;s for the menu item. Yeah. And then your big W or side icon gets you back to the menu out of the editor. So that&#8217;s kind of the workflow from browse mode to edit mode. Yeah. Then yeah, go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: So I was going to say, one of the cool things that was kind of frustrating for folks, that if you were in a certain mode in the editor and you refresh it, sometimes that mode won&#8217;t stick. So now that&#8217;s synchronized. So if you were to edit a mode and then refresh your page, it will go back to the same state that you were just in. So small little like quality of life improvements, but big ones if you&#8217;re in the site editor all the time. And another quality improvement was copy and paste, the shortcuts for copy and paste, now work in the site editor, which obviously is seemingly small, but a very important fix that we&#8217;re seeing there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And you only notice it when they don&#8217;t work. But yeah, when you try to do control C, control X and control V or command V for the paste and in which you use on any other editor around the world, be it your email, be it your Word or your Google Docs or even and all of a sudden in the editor it doesn&#8217;t work. So yeah, it definitely has been updated there. Now it comes to you. We talked about paste style to the block settings. Yeah, we talked about that. And then it&#8217;s now in 15.0, so if you upgrade your plugin to 15.1, 15.0 is still out. Yeah, 15.1 hasn&#8217;t been out yet. It&#8217;s only going to be released on February 8th, but you will be able to use those paste styles. And the next one is prevent an image from being resized larger than its container. Yeah, that was one of the things that really mixed up your layouts when that was not handled, but now it is and that&#8217;s a very good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. Working with image sometimes in the editor is tricky, and I think that this really makes it much more intuitive in the editor, between the editor view and the front end view. So that was a really good improvement to see there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And you see the borders now, so you know when you kind of go into outside the container and then it doesn&#8217;t let you, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Next up we have some improvements to navigation. There&#8217;s a lot of improvements to navigation between 5.0 and 5.1. For longtime observers of the Gutenberg project, navigation is probably one of the hardest things to get right and there&#8217;s so many moving parts in managing there. So, little improvements like add an icon, add a sub menu item option. There was a Phantom ghost inserter little artifact that was there that was confusing. Improving loading indicators and replacing setting menus when custom. This is going to sound too complicated, but lots of improvements to navigation that make it more intuitive and make the workflows better. And we&#8217;ll actually see some more of those as we continue into 15.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right, right. Yeah, the navigation block actually got a complete redesign or thinking of the process of creating menus in the block editor and it became the page list block got kind of a rejuvenation and a repurposing for that. So it&#8217;s in the sidebar, you can use the page list block, or the sidebar uses the page list block to actually create the menus. So there are some noise additional features in that particular block as well. Then the sidebar tabs, we talked about the block inspector tabs experiment with the split controls for the tabs. It will not see an additional tab whenever you use the navigation block and then it kind of uses the off canvas kind of navigation editor for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, so back to we were talking about tabs, so more tabs in the interface. And I think that once you get, it&#8217;s a little jarring, from before, but once you get used to it, it&#8217;s such an improvement. So now instead of having to manage the navigation menu all the way in the actual block, you can do it right on that sidebar off canvas functionality within the tab. So yeah, you&#8217;ll start to see a lot of tabs, but it&#8217;s a good thing. It will really make editing easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Especially for the navigation block where you never had enough space to do something like that or you never hit the right block or right border or right inserter. That was quite some confusion going on and this is definitely coming to 6.2, the total rethinking about the navigation block. And there are little things there. We talked about the next item is the edit the block style variations for global styles. We talked about that. That is now in Gutenberg 15.0 available. So try it out and see how that&#8217;s going to work. And those were the highlights from 15.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, there was one more, which was the sticky support for position, which we talked about. So that will be coming in 6.2 specifically for blocks that are not in containers. So that will enable sticky headers and footers. Again, this is kind of a first implementation, and as we move forward with Gutenberg and WordPress 6.3, there&#8217;ll be more position functionality, but this is a good first step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And if you want to help testing that, use the Gutenberg 15.0 plugin a version and just play around with it. And the more feedback you get in before beta, then the core contributors can fix some of the things that they haven&#8217;t found before, because they haven&#8217;t used it as much as you would. So yeah, that definitely will help how that&#8217;s going to turn out in 6.1, 6.2, sorry. Good. So that was 15.0. I haven&#8217;t seen anything else come in there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gutenberg 15.1</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Then let&#8217;s get right into 15.1 with the caveat that we are looking at the change log from 15.1 release candidate one, which was released on February 1st. The final release will be February 7th and everything that comes in before on Monday, no, on Tuesday will be in beta one from that particular release. So that is actually feature freeze from main features. All right. Do you want to take it on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, yeah. So the first thing going back to navigation was, in the site editor, there&#8217;s now in the browse mode, there&#8217;s now a navigation section where you can move around and manipulate the navigation menu. This is kind of an initial implementation and we&#8217;ll see in the future how much more gets built out, but it&#8217;s kind of neat. You can, in browse mode, you can modify your main navigation easily. The initial implementation is starting to look a lot like that, the classic menu management screen where it&#8217;s kind of an abstracted view of the menu and you can move things around and adjust things. So it&#8217;s a really interesting start. Personally, I would love to see in that browse menu sidebar being able to edit your templates, your template parts and your navigation and see all your menus there. A first step, but a really good one, and I think it&#8217;s really intuitive and it will be helpful for users to edit navigation menus.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, the next big feature that is coming with 15.1 is the add shadow presets and UI tools and global styles. The box shadow was already in there, but now it comes with a UI for users to change the drop shadows in the global styles. It&#8217;s a first iteration. Oh no, there won&#8217;t be any. It&#8217;s only going to be for button. And there is on the developer news blog, Justin Tadlock, who has quite a nice tutorial on how the block shadow feature is going to work for themes. So yeah, it&#8217;s definitely something that was missing before. Yeah, any thoughts on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, so the shadow functionality and what Justin wrote about is you can add drop shadows via manually adding the attributes to a block. So if you&#8217;re a theme developer, you&#8217;re designing a template and you can manually add that to the template file. We were just really missing that UI and the preset functionality. Similar to sticky UI for shadow and user experience for the shadow control is a little tricky, which is why the first implementation was get the functionality there from a template builder from a code perspective and now we&#8217;re starting to see the presets and the UI tools. So right now, there&#8217;s UI in global styles for button to add a global button styles with Shadow. First implementation, assuming that all works well and is intuitive, it will then be rolled out to additional blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the next one, I just wanted, it&#8217;s pretty minor, but I think it&#8217;s one that&#8217;s been sitting around since early last year. So a lot of blocks now you can add HTML anchors to or ID tags to. And dynamic blocks did not have this functionality. So things like post lists and I&#8217;m not remembering off the top of my head all the dynamic blocks that we have, but now it does. So anchor block is now supported across dynamic blocks. Pretty small change, but one that was needed because navigation and navigation items are dynamic blocks and so they did not have HTML anchor support. So a small little thing that people have been asking for a long time. It&#8217;s good to see that that&#8217;s been included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s really hard to target multiple things that don&#8217;t have at ease and could be really good. Yeah. And yeah, 15.1 comes with a ton of changes to the navigation block. Part of it is the off-camera navigation as a default experience. Then adding manage menu buttons for the menu selector dropdown. So, if you switch from one theme to the next, menus are persistent. And also, if you change from the classic to your block theme, you will find your classic themes menu available through the navigation block. That&#8217;s also very seamless now. And there are also custom labels for the navigation block view through the list view appender so you can name things quite a bit. We talked about copy and pasting styles menu items to separate menu group? No, we didn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s also navigation enhancement where you can copy and paste styles menu items to a separate menu group so it shows up in different places where you use that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, little enhancements that go a long way. As we move down the list here, we also saw a lot of improvements to the custom CSS, the ability to add that custom CSS right in global styles, some refinements to descriptions, refinements to what we&#8217;re calling it. Also, the custom CSS used to be just a panel that you would see immediately when you went into Global Styles. It&#8217;s been a little bit more hidden. The main reason, once you know where it is, very easy to find, but for new users to the site editor, it&#8217;s a little overwhelming to be presented with all those options. So now that is a bit hidden within the global styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and it also comes with a validation kind of process. So when you add your customer CSS to make sure that that&#8217;s actually valid code, it gives you a little message there and checks it out. So it&#8217;s really good. There&#8217;s also the per block custom CSS. We talked about it earlier. It comes with 15.1. It&#8217;s very late in the process to be tested quite a lot in the Gutenberg plugin. But check it out and see how that works for you. I&#8217;m really interested on the use case for that. I also saw a use case or request for use case for getting post single post custom CSS panel, but that is, I think, will stay plugins territory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a plugin in the Repo where you can do that, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to come to core because it&#8217;s not block-based anymore. It&#8217;s kind of content based and that&#8217;s a little bit tricky to do. Yeah, and you mentioned it before, 15.1 also adds some of the missing controls to the flex layouts, the vertical alignment for the stack blocks, and also the ability for minimum height in the stacks and make the flex layouts now really powerful for theme developers as well as site owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, really excited for this one. This is going to reduce the amount of custom CSS themed developers need to build some sophisticated layouts. Really a cool one. One of those little minor things on the list here, but actually is super impactful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I see we also highlighted, for the sticky position, you mentioned it before. It&#8217;s a block that&#8217;s not on a root block. Kind of being on the canvas will not be able to be sticky for now because the user experience concerns are a little bit not yet worked out. So it will be a limited functionality. And then the last part is renaming. So web fonts has been around, talked about since 6.0, was supposed to get in 6.0. There was a big flag raised from Core Committers and since then the core team has worked on that. 15.1 comes with a rename of the font&#8217;s API, but I also saw in our release channel on the Mac block that Tanya Mork announced that the fund&#8217;s API won&#8217;t make it into 6.2. She posted it on February 1st in the release channel. That is actually public. You can anytime kind of go into the six dash two dash release dash leads channel on the Make WordPress Slack and see what the discussion is about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it will not make it. It&#8217;s slated for the Gutenberg plugin in 15.1, but it comes out only a day after beta one for 6.1. So 6.2 and it won&#8217;t make it the API. She finds it needs several Gutenberg releases to stabilize. And after they did a complete rewrite on it and renamed it and the last rewrites happened for Gutenberg 15.1, but that&#8217;s just too close to the beta release. The next focus will be to getting the API stabilized, assessing and improving the performance of it, and then adding automatic font and queuing for all fonts in clover styles. And then developers upgrading to use a new API with a backwards compatibility layer. And that is temporary. So all those seem to be doable to target very early for the 6.3 release alpha. That kind of starts after 6.2 is released, which is in May. So they&#8217;ll find things in the core nightly and goodnight nightly after the 6.2 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s one of those things where it&#8217;s taken a while, but it needs to take a while to make sure everything is in the right shape. And we just got to wait a little bit longer, but very soon we&#8217;ll be able to test it in the Gutenberg plugin, which is awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And then we have one last item, I think, from 15.1 that we talk about. Make child themes inherit parents style variation, which is pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, block themes is one of those things where people are familiar with child themes and block themes obviously want to support child themes as well. And if you have a parent with a bunch of style variations like 2023 and you want to make a few changes in a child theme, you want to also pull those style variations over. So a nice intuitive improvement to child theming in a block based world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, and that, dear listeners, concludes our Gutenberg plugin 15.1 release change log. And we are pretty much at the end of the show. And it&#8217;s been quite the long show, but it&#8217;s also important to talk about what&#8217;s going to buoy you in 6.2. So thank you so much, Nick, on walking us through or going with me as a co-host through all those different changes and talk about the advantages and disadvantages of many, many things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, thank you again for having me. I cannot wait for the 6.2 release. I think we&#8217;re going to get so many new functionality that will empower block builders, block theme builders, end users, so on and so forth. So very much looking forward to it. And thanks again for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes, and that&#8217;s wonderful. So, as always, the show notes will be published. At gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is the episode 79, and if you have questions or suggestions or news you want to include, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. That&#8217;s <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. And I also want to have, I will share the last WP Briefing episode by Josepha Hayden Chomphosy, where she talks about now if Gutenberg part two is kind of coming to an end, what does that mean? We still will add refinements to the plugin into the editors, even if the collaboration phase kind of starts soon in 2023. But I will share that so you can hear it from the executive director of the open source project. I also am really excited for the 6.2 release, and I hope people hear you with the episode 80 of the Gutenberg change log in about two to four weeks.

A paid basic tier will be available instead <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png\" alt=\"🧵\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>&mdash; Twitter Dev (@TwitterDev) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterDev/status/1621026986784337922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 2, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to a user who conjectured that this move is more about raising the friction to making bots, Elon Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1621259936524300289\">responded</a>, saying that this is one factor motivating the change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Yeah, free API is being abused badly right now by bot scammers and opinion manipulators,&#8221; Musk said. &#8220;There’s no verification process or cost, so easy to spin up 100k bots to do bad things. Just ~$100/month for API access with ID verification will clean things up greatly.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear how this will effect the Twitter ecosystem, whether it will impact bots that auto-tweet links from blogs and other useful tools. So far it is already <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@Tibor/109800904950500383\">affecting some migration tools</a> like <a href=\"https://movetodon.org/\">Movetodon</a> that rely on the Twitter API to help users find their contacts on Mastodon. Movetodon&#8217;s creator said his app&#8217;s access was shut down today. According to Twitter, the app “has violated Twitter Rules and policies.” <a href=\"https://fedifinder.glitch.me/\">Fedifinder</a>, a tool that helps users find the Fediverse accounts of their Twitter contacts, is still up and running at the time of publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NetNewsWire, an open source news aggregator, has already <a href=\"https://nnw.ranchero.com/2023/02/02/twitter-integration-to.html\">announced</a> it will be removing Twitter integration in its next release:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>You might think we’re reading RSS feeds from Twitter, but Twitter removed RSS feeds from the service something like ten years ago. We rely completely on the Twitter API.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress&#8217; Plugins team published a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2023/02/03/twitter-api-changes/\">notice</a>, alerting developers and site owners of Twitter&#8217;s upcoming API change. The team warned that the following types of Twitter plugins might be affected:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Auto-posting</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Login with Twitter</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Analytics</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Management Tools</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Scripted Interactions (auto-blocking etc)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If your plugin (or the related service) does any of those, you will have to investigate if this change impacts you,&#8221; Plugin Review Team Rep Mika Epstein said. &#8220;If you are impacted, you will need to update (or close) your plugin accordingly. I know a lot of free plugins will have some hard choices to make here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For plugin users, if a plugin suddenly breaks on/around the 9th, please be generous and kind to the developers. They really got blindsided by this, and it’s a lot to sort out in a short amount of time.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress plugin developer Joe Dolson, author of WP to Twitter and WP Tweets Pro, <a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/2023/02/wp-to-twitter-wp-tweets-pro-and-twitters-new-api-policies/\">published</a> an early reaction to the news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WP to Twitter makes very little revenue as it is,&#8221; Dolson said. &#8220;If I end up doing a lot of support because of this, or need to make significant changes to the plug-in, I will most likely just shut everything down and close the plug-in. That’s a purely practical decision.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dolson also said if the API costs are affordable for the average small user, then he will likely keep things as they are. This is because API access for the plugin is managed through each users&#8217; developer account with Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If the API costs are very expensive for the average small user, I suspect that will completely destroy the WP to Twitter user base, and there will be little to no justification to my continuing to maintain it,&#8221; Dolson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many users are likely not technical enough to understand what an API is, let alone why free access is being cut off. This could create a major support burden for plugins that no longer work after February 9. Developers who become frustrated with the platform becoming less open, may no longer be motivated to create these kinds of tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@twitter</a> are removing free API access my \"Fetch my Tweets\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WordPress?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@WordPress</a> plugin is likely to longer work, all these platforms are just getting harder and harder to do anything interesting with!</p>&mdash; Paul Jackson (@pixelsandthings) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pixelsandthings/status/1621262819717955585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 2, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>With just one week&#8217;s notice, and very few details, developers have little time to react. Once Twitter releases more information next week about its API changes, plugin developers will need to be ready to take action with notices written to help users understand what is happening.

Today he leads <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alleyco\">Alley Interactive</a>, an agency focused on publishers, non-profits, museums, and brands. Brad shares his extensive experience in publishing technology and his view of the strengths and challenges within the enterprise market of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shifting to Paywall Content.</strong> Perhaps a major misstep in early online publishing was setting the expectation of free content. Now print subscriptions are down. Publishers can’t secure advertising without extremely high volume. And consumers are hesitant to pay for online subscriptions.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>WordPress Creator Economies. </strong>Within WordPress there are software and content creators. Software creators the directory to serve as a centralized community and marketplace. Content creators face a bigger challenge to find their market because there isn’t a collaboration tool and algorithm like a social platform driving the creator economy of WordPress.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enterprise WordPress vs. Competition. </strong>The closed platforms have appeal-single providers, monthly pricing models, built-in solutions. To customers who aren’t aware of the benefits of open source, it can be confusing to help them understand the optionality and freedom they relinquish even if the initial investment of time and money is more. Enterprise WordPress faces the challenge of crafting appealing solutions without becoming the antithesis of open source.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"is-layout-flex wp-container-26 wp-block-columns sponsor has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\" id=\"StellarWP\">\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-column\">\n<h3 class=\"StellarWP has-theme-palette-1-color has-text-color\" id=\"Sponsor\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <span><a href=\"https://poststat.us/elementor\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\">Elementor</a></span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Elementor </strong>enables web creators to build professional, pixel-perfect websites with an intuitive visual builder.

Welcome back to another Post Status draft episode. And this is, uh, another interview and story in our agency journey series. Um, I&#8217;ve got Brad, who&#8217;s been a member of Post Status for a long time that leads, uh, Allie Interactive. Um, but we&#8217;re gonna. Talk about his story in just a little bit. But, um, you know, I&#8217;m always interested in these stories because how you got there, where you were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we&#8217;re gonna talk a little bit about WordPress in the future. And, um, but Brad, thanks again for, um, being, taking some time to share your story and journey. Could you tell us a little bit about yourself and your, your origin story with WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> Yeah. Thanks Corey. Thank you for, for having me on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah, I started with WordPress around about, I wanna say 2008, 2009. Uh, I spent, I spent my entire career [00:01:00] working in publishing technology up to this point, and, uh, I started at. Forbes Magazine, uh, in right around 2001. Uh, I eventually worked for forbes.com and, you know, towards the, the end of my tenure there, we were getting into launching some blogs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, I thought this WordPress platform looked pretty cool. Uh, I believe version three had just come out and, and, and it was starting to look, you know, a little more. Enterprise technology. Uh, you know, up to that point, you know, I think Droople was probably even Jula, I hate to say, was, was, uh, you know, an, an early, uh, adopter in the early, had some early adoption in the enterprise market, but WordPress was really picking up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I liked the, I liked the technology behind it. I liked the interface a lot better than either of those platforms and, you know, just really on my own, took over a, a spare server and started to build out some blogs. Um, I, I had finally left the company in, in [00:02:00] 2010, but, Shortly after I left, WordPress actually took over, you know, their entire c m s at least for, for a period of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, it, it was good to see, um, WordPress start to get some, some enterprise adoption, uh, in that, in that market. Um, you know, and, and still at that phase, you know, WordPress was still. You know, I, I would say more uncommon than common, you know, for, for usage and enterprise publishing. You know, fast forward to, um, you know, 2010, I, I had taken over as CTO of a, of a small media company and we had a need to build out a couple of foreign language sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, we had actually chosen Droople at that time, uh, not WordPress and. My COO at the time, um, had previously worked at the New York Observer, um, with a couple of folks, uh, Austin Smith and, and Matt Johnson, uh, who had just founded a, a very small [00:03:00] agency, uh, of three people called Ali. And, uh, I, I became acquainted with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, hired them to build, build those two sites for us. So I actually became one of Ali&#8217;s first clients, uh, before I even worked here, uh, which, which was pretty cool. Um, stayed in touch with them. Uh, and then, uh, 2012 when I was, uh, c t o of a, a small startup, um, which, Wasn&#8217;t, wasn&#8217;t the best job I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say, uh, I won&#8217;t name the company. Um, but Ali was just starting to really, um, grow at that time. Uh, they were about to land, uh, their first set of really big enterprise clients, uh, a couple of which we still work with to this day. They&#8217;re also getting more into WordPress because, you know, the, the market really seemed to be starting to head in that direction, at least for open source enterprise publishing technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had built up a lot of WordPress knowledge at the startup that I was working at. You know, we had, we had stayed in touch over the, the last couple of [00:04:00] years and. Uh, I, I decided to join them and there were, I think, six of us at that point. And, you know, later, um, you know, shortly thereafter became, uh, the, the third partner in the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve added a, uh, several others since, but, uh, you know, we&#8217;ve grown to a team of 70 people since then. So there&#8217;s a lot that happened in between. But, you know, it, it was an interesting journey to, to get to, you know, where I am today. Um, you know, as CEO of the. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. Well, you kinda shared some of that snippet of your journey related to Allie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, what does Allie do in WordPress in the world? Like who, who are your kind of focused clients? Um, what are the kind of types of work you do related to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> Yeah. When, when Austin and Matt, you know, originally founded the company, um, what was great is that you. I think the three of us always shared a common vision for, for what we wanted it to [00:05:00] be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and, and really a common interest in, in the types of clients that we wanna work with. You know, the. The worldview that the company was, was founded with wa was with the, the First Amendment as the, the company&#8217;s North Star. Uh, you know, a strong belief in freedom of the press, um, and, and really helping, you know, it sounds very bold, the helping civilization bridge the divide from, you know, pre to post internet free speech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so the, the partners in the agency have always staunchly supported publishing and, and as a result, you know, we have only ever worked with publishers. Uh, you know, we started with. A lot of expertise in, specifically in news media. Um, you know, Austin and Matt had experience working for companies like the New York Observer, um, New York Times Slate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I, I had worked at Forbes and a couple other media companies, so, you know, we, we had a lot of experience there, but, You know, it, [00:06:00] it became clear that there were, you know, others who really fit that, that definition as publishers that were also important and interesting for us to work with. So, you know, early on, one of our first big clients was, was the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and since then we&#8217;ve worked with a lot of other nonprofit publishers, you know, who have, you know, just as an, an important mission supporting their communities as our news media clients do supporting free. Um, you know, and we&#8217;ve worked with some book publishers and, and cultural institutions as well, but, you know, allie&#8217;s like never gonna build an an eCommerce site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re, you know, not gonna get into, you know, other areas of, of, you know, WordPress development and design. Uh, it, it&#8217;s always been focused on publishers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> That&#8217;s cool, especially with your background, uh, in publishing. Um, Forbes, obviously everybody knows Forbes. Um, and one of the strengths I&#8217;ve seen of WordPress, obviously it&#8217;s democratized publishing, so that that lines, and I love the, [00:07:00] the focus on the First Amendment, and the free speech part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s excellent. So with a lot of these publishers as being kind of a default client of what you all focus. Um, what&#8217;s the type of work, can you, and, and I know there&#8217;s clients you might not be able to talk about, so I, I totally respect that, but what&#8217;s the type of work you&#8217;re doing for some of these clients?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it rebuilds, is it park maintenance? Is it responding to a news team or a room or something like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> Yeah. You know, and, and I think that that&#8217;s part of the, You know, evolution of the company that I sort of glossed over between about 2012 and now. Um, when, when I started you, you know, Allie originally, um, the folks that started it myself and, and, uh, and Austin and Matt and, you know, we, we, everyone that started the company and was there in the early days were, we&#8217;re all developers and, you know, we all had experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, as programmers, you know, I wrote code for. [00:08:00] Pretty much until about five years ago, um, you know, full-time. Uh, and you know, so that&#8217;s where we started. You know, we partnered with, uh, large organizations to build out, you know, solid publishing technology, infrastructure, you know, with the caveat that we understood publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had. Worked with folks in newsrooms. So, you know, although at that time we weren&#8217;t doing actual, like web design, we understood how to design a CMS that was efficient and, and that took the experience of the editors, you know, into account. Because, you know, very often, you know, I, I, I saw it in my, in my own career for many years, folks would build things for, you know, for editors to use, folks who.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often on a deadline trying to get a story out quickly. And the interface would be clunky, it would be slow, it would be inefficient, you know, too many clicks, too many steps, not intuitive. Um, so that part of what [00:09:00] we do was there from the beginning. Um, but early on we were working with, you know, primarily outside designers to, to actually, you know, create the designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had a couple of agencies that we used to partner with, you know, relatively frequently. It became clear to us like round about 2014, uh, that, that, that was a pretty inefficient way to work. And, and so about eight, no, now, now nine years ago, we started our own design practice internally and, and now really, you know, we, we&#8217;ve become truly a, a full service agency from strategy to design to, to development it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just so much more, much more of an efficient experience for the folks that we work with to have, you know, A single team under one roof that has all the skills end to end to, you know, thoughtfully think through what we should be building for them. Because, you know, we&#8217;re not just implementing code and design and products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re helping to transform their business. You know, like especially on for r and D&#8217;s media [00:10:00] clients, you know, creating. A product that generates sustainable revenue for them is very important. Um, and, and the only way that we could do that effectively was to bring everything under, under one roof. Um, . You know, one of the other things that we always saw, you know, in, in working with an outside design firm is you always had this, this dreaded handoff, you know, of, of the design from one agency, um, to the other, you know, to us for implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, back then it was, you know, Photoshop files. Eventually it became, Envision and then Figma. Um, but, you know, regardless, you know, developers who weren&#8217;t necessarily in the room when the product was being conceived are now being forced to interpret it. And certainly, um, you know, especially once, you know, responsive design became a thing, you know, we all, we all take it for granted now, but.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, not every breakpoint situation, you know, potential flow of text around embeds and images was, was thought about. And a [00:11:00] lot&#8217;s left up to interpretation. But, you know, by having developers and designers on a single team, you know, we are able to do a lot more design and browser. You know, we can create a Desi, uh, a style guide and immediately go to code and, and we know that the product works earlier on and, and it really saves our clients a lot of time and money and hassle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, really we&#8217;re not, we don&#8217;t wanna waste people&#8217;s time, you know, doing things that can be done in a better way. If we wanna spend our time, most of our time, you know, thoughtfully thinking through, you know, what is the best product that we can build for them that&#8217;s gonna meet their goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, I asked the question cuz I know, um, you all recently posted a job on post status for, I think it was senior WordPress developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m curious what a senior WordPress developer at Alley, you know, does like, what&#8217;s their week or day look like? You know, coming in, working with these, like, I, I was just going to your website and I was like, New York Post National Science [00:12:00] Foundation, um, of course the Kaiser Foundation and. That&#8217;s exciting to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m, my background is as being a journalist, but I, these are name brand, very well known, huge organizations doing really good work in the world. And I wor and I wonder like, how does that connect down to that WordPress developer at Ali doing work on like a weekly basis because, um, I come from the product side and always, you know, some people prefer the product side, but there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s a potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monotony. Okay. I&#8217;m just doing these things with client work and some of these clients, I&#8217;m like, oh, there&#8217;s gotta be something new pushing the envelope every day. Uh, publishing is changing, web is changing, and all that. So what does a, a typical week in a WordPress developer&#8217;s life look like at Ali?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> Yeah, it, it, it&#8217;s certainly, I mean, it&#8217;s certainly interesting, you know, for for sure, you know, every, every team has, uh, [00:13:00] typically a, a mix of one or more clients that they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re supporting and in the long term, you know, we.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really value having long-term relationship with, with our clients now, I would say the, the vast majority of work that we do after we build something, we end up, you know, working with that client for months or years afterwards. I think our longest client relationship is probably hitting 11 years this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, which is, which, which is pretty crazy to me. It&#8217;s, um, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a long time. All, all of our teams, uh, in general are, are dedicated Scrum teams that work with, you know, a client or a particular, you know, set of clients. Uh, so our, our developers. You know, tend to say working on, on the same teams, you know, month over month, even, you know, even year over year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and, you know, they are working with, uh, you know, a product manager, a scrub master, um, you know, a designer if, if they&#8217;re working on a team that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s in the midst of a design [00:14:00] project. So, you know, they are, they&#8217;re part of a team that&#8217;s that&#8217;s trying to. You know, come up with Yeah. Ongoing solutions for, you know, whatever business problems our, our clients are trying to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and yeah, in the case of something like the New York Post, you know, where, which you mentioned, um, it&#8217;s not even just implementing product, you know, that&#8217;s really interesting work for, um, the developers working on that project because we&#8217;re. Often pushing the bounds of, of WordPress and WordPress, VIP and, and you know, what those particular platforms can do to serve WordPress at scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re talking about, you know, hundreds of millions of people that are, that are trying to access a WordPress site. Um, you know, which is pretty amazing when you try to, when you think about where. You know, WordPress came from, its, its origin 20 years ago. Um, you know, the sites we built are probably serving collectively billions of page views a month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, so, you know, WordPress has really, you know, hit that, hit that true enterprise scale. Um, [00:15:00] which is probably something more we can, we can, we can talk about later. Um, but yeah, the, the average developer that you know is, is working at Ali is, is solving, uh, Really interesting, complex problems. Um, but also they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re serving Ali&#8217;s mission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re supporting publishers, you know, they&#8217;re not just, um, writing code for the sake of writing code. They&#8217;re writing code that&#8217;s helping, you know, keep the world informed or, or helping communities, uh, you know, beyond, you know, what they&#8217;re doing. You know, just, just day to day working at Ali.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Any, any way you&#8217;re able to combine making meaning. With money, profits and perfect, uh, purpose. I, I love that. And serving that, hiring good with, while getting paid, you know, to do and solve problems every day. So. Okay. I&#8217;m curious, you have an extensive background with publishing and this is a little bit off my normal scope, but I want to go where, where you know people are [00:16:00] and get your feedback and vision and thoughts publishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I go back to the actual print. I remember my first job. I was like in awe, seeing this big printing press, you know, go around and something came out the other side and then, um, I would drive home and by the time I got home that paper would be on my doorstep. Internet revolution, all that revolutionized all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;ve seen so much with publishing. I&#8217;m curious, you know, the web just continues to acceler. With and, and technology accelerates. What are you seeing with publishing? How has that evolved in your, you know, in your career? What are you seeing in the future for it? We&#8217;ve got, like I just saw medium. Um, embraced Macedon, which we&#8217;ve talked about on this podcast, uh, the fed averse and all that. And, you know, again, the, the headline is another billionaire buys a [00:17:00] big social network, and, but I&#8217;ve seen this trend. I love publishing, I love publishing with WordPress. I, I just wanna ask the general question. What are you seeing now? What are you seeing in the future for publishing on the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I, gosh, like this, this could be an entire podcast episode, but it, it should be, you know, . What, what I will say is that when I started working full-time in publishing, um, you know, 20 years ago and, and I had been. You know, aware of the publishing technology world. Prior to that, my, I actually got into this business because my, my uncle actually helped design the first, uh, electronic publishing system at Time Magazine in the seventies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s really like comical to me to look at the, I have, I solved the Frame Blueprint, um, believe it or not, . Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> That&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> It had, it had a massive array of two, 300 megabyte hard drives that, that [00:18:00] pub powered the entire system. Anyway, what What was comical to me about it was that they were all dumb terminals that ran off a central server, and then we went into this whole desktop publishing revolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone had this whole end-to-end suite of. You know, very complicated, expensive applications, um, on their desktop computers. And now we&#8217;re doing everything in web browsers, connecting to a server. So we actually had it figured out like 50 years ago, and then we kind of straight away for, from a bit, and then we came back to it, which is, which is amusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but, you know, the, the, the bigger, the bigger thing to me about the transition from. Print to web and, and where we are today is, you know, like 20 years ago when I was first getting into this and we were starting to, you know, really see, um, uh, proliferation of publishers, you know, launching more, you know, full featured websites that, you know, weren&#8217;t just, you know, a few articles thrown up here and there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like they might have been in the late ni in the [00:19:00] mid to late nineties for the very early adopters. And they were, they were full-fledged products with unique content of their own. But I think that a lot of publishers, and, and I have some, some stories that I, that I can&#8217;t share, but I, but I know certainly details about how certain publishers thought about things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but there was a prevailing sentiment that the websites then were an experiment, you know, or, or even, uh, you know, a toy, they, they. Viewed as being necessarily, you know, the, a real publication, the way that the, the newspaper or the magazine or whatever it is, was, um, so they were free and, and we set this, this expectation very early on that websites were, were free. You would just go and read them and, you know, there were a few that had a paywall, but, um, you know, charging for content online back then was also super hard [00:20:00] because the payment technology stunk. Um, people, you know, weren&#8217;t. Quite used to, to buying things online yet like they are now, you know, eBay, Amazon sure they existed, but it&#8217;s not like it is today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, the, the payment systems that were available, you know, had a fair degree of friction to them. Um, you didn&#8217;t necessarily have the consumer market for it. The, the publishers themselves, especially, you know, folks like at the, at the C-suite level, didn&#8217;t really view them as being a primary business driver yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, you know, then, then of course things changed. Everything moved online. Um, you know, throughout the mid two thousands, you know, we just started to shovel ads onto the sites and we were getting loads of traffic and making tons of money for advertisers. And then, you know, advertisers started to get savvy about things like viewability and click through rates, and it&#8217;s like, oh wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, real human beings probably aren&#8217;t seeing about 80 or 90% of these [00:21:00] ads. And then, You know, that whole market just cratered and you know, so now you&#8217;re left with this dilemma where most of the traffic to your publication is now online. People want to consume content that way, and it gets hard to start to shift the mindset that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, to, to that you should be paying for this content. Um, and, you know, you can still make money on advertising, but it takes a tremendous amount of volume. Um, or it takes an extremely niche market. Um, you know, for example, Um, you know, a site like the Points Guy Travel site, you know, they make a ton of money on, on, on credit card referrals, which are really high, um, you know, high value things that, that, that, that those companies are going to pay for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, you know, those examples are few and far between and you&#8217;re, and you&#8217;re left with this, you know, this middle ground where. You know, publishers aren&#8217;t getting the subscription revenue from the websites that they need to get. They&#8217;re not getting the ad [00:22:00] revenue they need to get, and they&#8217;re having dwindling print subscriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so, you know, how do all of these important organizations that are keeping the world informed, you know, continue to exist? And, and that&#8217;s an ongoing challenge that, you know, we are trying. To help our clients work through. And, and there&#8217;s really no, you know, one size fits all solution for, for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, during the, during 2020, during, in 2021, during the pandemic, when. Us, like a lot of folks had a, had a little downturn in business, we had some availability. Um, you know, that&#8217;s why we started working on our lead platform, um, L E D E for all you publishing nerds out there. Um, and you know, that was specifically geared towards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Startup, subscription driven publications, you know, to help create the next generation of, of sustainable journalism. You know, everyone on the platform, you know, has, has paywall content. They charge a subscription fee. [00:23:00] Um, and, and we&#8217;re helping them, you know, build out those communities to, to, you know, create, you know, really the next generation of publishers because without things like that, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s really hard for them to get off the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You. If you have funding for a startup publication, you, it&#8217;s probably pretty limited, and you shouldn&#8217;t be spending it on technology. You should be spending it on hiring writers and, and, and, you know, enabling those people to go out and, and, and do their jobs and, you know, you know, create great content. So, um, it just, you know, anyway, it&#8217;s a challenge, but, but I think that we all really screwed up back in the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, in the early two thousands when, you know, we didn&#8217;t set the expectation that, you know, you have to pay for this. Did you pay for your newspaper before that? Did you pay for your magazine? Of course you did. . Yep. You know, maybe you&#8217;d, maybe you&#8217;d read it for free if you had found it on the train or you were sitting at the dentist&#8217;s office, but you know, if you wanted that, that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content for yourself in the comfort of your own home. You paid your [00:24:00] subscription fee. So yeah. Um, there, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a big reset that&#8217;s going on now and, and, and, you know, and you know, uh, we want to be here to help our clients, you know, think through that, work through that, and, and, you know, use our experience to, you know, hopefully guide them in the right direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, there&#8217;s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> too many outlets. I think quite a bit about that, that seem to have. A big transition. This is why I got outta the newspaper. So it&#8217;s like they weren&#8217;t embracing technology. It&#8217;s like you said, they set a wrong expectation from the beginning. It&#8217;s like, how do you preserve that? And the two I think of are Washington Post in the New York Times, the, the Gray lady, I think she&#8217;s still called, um, iconic journalist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, organizations, um, and I see the New York I, I&#8217;ve watched The New York Times, obviously I use Word all every day, but I go, you know, it seems like they had some good traction with digital subscriptions and, and things like that. And so I love that cuz [00:25:00] there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s such a part of this fourth estate that it, that we need as a society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quality journalism, sharing, like you said, inform the world of what&#8217;s going on. Uh, and it&#8217;s sad because I&#8217;ve seen what used to be local. Like, the newspapers I worked for were local, city based, you know, small compared to the one we just talked about. And, um, there&#8217;s a vital need that they played in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now contrast that too. So what do you think? Are you seeing trends and things? Obviously you, I, I looked up lead here and I love the name by the way. Um, lead. So trying to help them build community. So that&#8217;s another part of some of the things we&#8217;re seeing in publishing. It&#8217;s not just inform. It&#8217;s, I mean, post status is a very microcosm of this is like, we do news, I guess we do content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but really we&#8217;re a community. Um, and, and I&#8217;ve seen that with business, how we&#8217;ve added community into business. We did this at I [00:26:00] themes, uh, now with post status is going okay. I don&#8217;t, we get labeled as a news outlet, but I go, we&#8217;re we&#8217;re community, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re relational. Um, what are some of those things you&#8217;re seeing with, uh, within the publishing organizations you all work with?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building that community. You see, uh, authors and writers building their own community, like Twitter instantly goes, okay, you can&#8217;t see ESPN or any of the big things. You see the little, here&#8217;s the anchor or writer or whatever it is talking, and there&#8217;s a Twitter byline. They&#8217;ve cultivated their own kind of followings and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what are you seeing with those kind of trends related to lead, uh, lead in the work that you all do with your clients?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong>  Yeah, with on, on Leads specifically, you know, I obviously, you know, you could, you know, from an economic standpoint, you could gauge the success of the community through the number of subscriptions they get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, obviously if people wanna pay you money, they wanna be part of, you know, what, what you have going on. But, um, one of, one of the most interesting things I see [00:27:00] within, within Lead is with, with Defector, which is probably the, you know, one of the largest sites we run on the platform, and you know, how.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How many websites do you go to that actually have a decent comment section under their articles? Um, you know, not, not many. Uh, you know, in fact, some of our clients have started to only selectively enable comments or disable them entirely because there just wasn&#8217;t productive. . And you know, pretty much every defector article that that gets written has dozens of comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, not only do the people wanna read the articles, they wanna discuss them with each other, with the other folks that are, that are reading the site. And they&#8217;re actually like, really funny and interesting, you know, like arguments and comments and, and um, you know, discussions around the topics at hand that go back and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, to me, I would gauge that as being a success over, over anything else. I, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m part of that community as well. I mean, I&#8217;m probably a little biased. I was a big fan of Deadspin, [00:28:00] um, back in the day. But, you know, I think what you said, Um, before when you were introducing, that was also really interesting, which is the, the, the topic of local news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think local news is, is been affected by this shift. You know, more than anyone, you know, if the Washington Post and the New York Times, you know, decide to start, you know, charging a subscription fee, which of course they both did, you know, um, many years ago. Yeah, with their scale, it&#8217;s easier to maintain some degree of profitability and they have profits coming from, from other areas as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not just their, their online subscription revenue, um, you know, cuz they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re catering to a national audience. The New York Times is, and the, and the Washington Post are. New York City and Washington DC papers in, in name only, you know, they, they certainly have a, both have a metro beat, which, which covers the local area, but the majority of the content appears to a national, even a global audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re just dealing with a different scale. Um, [00:29:00] you know, there are so many local news deserts that have developed over the last decade across the country where, Um, you know, the local paper is just gone, or, you know, there were three local papers, even in major metropolitan areas. Now there&#8217;s one local paper, um, and, and you don&#8217;t have any, you know, dissenting opinions and you don&#8217;t have enough coverage to, to reach every community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and that news is just disappearing, you know? No, no one&#8217;s covering it. Um, you know, with, with folks. Buying print subscriptions with, you know, not even having the scale to, to, to generate any online revenue. Um, you know, it&#8217;s really hard. So they end up getting. A lot of them that do still exist end up getting, you know, slurped up by one of the, the major conglomerates that&#8217;s purchasing lots of local news organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and even then you, you, you&#8217;re seeing their operations get gutted in favor of centralizing, you know, copy editing and, and, and lots of other services. [00:30:00] So, , you know, the actual folks that are on the ground covering things are really limited and, you know, there are stories that are slipping through the cracks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I mean, I mean, look at, look at, I live in New York City, right? I mean, and, and the New York City metropolitan area is a huge market. We have multiple papers. And you know, something like the George Santos story, which was definitely covered by a local media organization, you know, slips through the cracks to the point where, you know, someone was elected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stevie had lied about some things, . So it, it&#8217;s really just, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s quite remarkable that even in a, even in a market like, you know, New York City, um, something like that can happen these days. So, um, you know, I think we, we really, we, we have a lot of questions we have to answer and I, and I don&#8217;t have all of them today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah. You know, but certainly it, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a goal of mine to help, you know, help help us, help our client organizations work, work through these challenges. Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So thank you for that. Cause I just wanna get perspectives, um, cuz this is, the [00:31:00] publishing is central to WordPress and, you know, switching, uh, uh, an area here for a second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just wanna get your quick thoughts on this and then we&#8217;ll move on to WordPress on the enterprise, but, You know, my story with WordPress is I started my first WordPress blog in 2006, not really to anything I&#8217;m doing today, but it, it enabled me, empowered me to be able to publish and that that was an incredible experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking publish on my first WordPress site. and there&#8217;s this trend that I see and I go, yeah, we called them bloggers back then, but the creator economy, and I&#8217;m just kinda, I know this isn&#8217;t your bread and butter, but it is in a bigger category that you all serve at a high, high level. Um, but the creator economy, the ability to someone to go on an Instagram, create content, engage a kind of followers slash community, and I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>opportunity with WordPress two. Um, my wife looks at Instagram quite a bit. That&#8217;s kind of [00:32:00] her default entertainment channel. And one day she was like, just look. Cuz I was like, ah, I don&#8217;t have time. I, I don&#8217;t want to get, I&#8217;ll go down that rabbit patrol. But I started looking at some of the people that created content and go, they&#8217;ve got massive followings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you go business model creator economy. And I think WordPress is positioned there to go, how do you monetize it? Same problem we have on the big scale publishers. We talked about how do we find a sustain. Business model for that classic journalism, local news, news in general, but then for the creator economy, I&#8217;m curious your thoughts on that, what you&#8217;re seeing, what you hope for, uh, in that, I ha have the ability now to create or press blog or Twitter account or a Instagram or whatever that is, and become a de facto one person publishing company and myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What, what are you seeing for that? Do you pay attention to that? What are you curious about seeing</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> for. Yeah, and there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a lot there. Um, you know, for, for WordPress itself, [00:33:00] you know, you, you essentially have, you know, two creator economies. You have those that are creating the software and those that are creating the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s actually a, you know, a, a a really a double pronged creator economy, um, within the WordPress world itself. You know, for, for something like. You know, TikTok or Instagram or, or you know, Twitter, um, you know, as probably less so, you know, Twitter to a degree. Cuz I feel like, you know, primarily folks are, you know, following people that they&#8217;ve chosen to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and if they&#8217;re getting exposed to other accounts, it&#8217;s usually through retweets, you know, um, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a little less algorithmic than I would say, you know, especially TikTok, which is entirely algorithmic. . But, but the point is, you know, those are little, little snippets of information. Um, you know, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a lot of discovery, um, that&#8217;s inherent to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you, you end up finding [00:34:00] people to follow through others that you&#8217;re following through, through algorithmic recommendations depending on, on the platform. Um, and, you know, they&#8217;re little. Snippets of entertainment, you know, that don&#8217;t require a ton of engagement. You know, your, your average engagement there is, is measured in seconds, not minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s really just an endless stream of stuff that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s triggering your dopamine receptors, and, and, mm-hmm. , um, you know, making you entertained and abused. And look, there are creators that are creating like some really. Interesting, thoughtful, you know, content, whether it&#8217;s, you know, stuff that is pertinent to my industry, um, you know, historical content stuff that&#8217;s, you know, extremely socially aware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there&#8217;s a lot of stuff that you can get exposed to on this, on those platforms that&#8217;s, um, meaningful and interesting. And there&#8217;s a lot that&#8217;s just, you know, purely entertainment. It doesn&#8217;t have a lot of depth to it, but it makes you laugh or, you know, whatever. You [00:35:00] know, WordPress, I mean WordPress is a platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a tool. Um, it lets people create a different type of content. Um, you know, typically, typically written content, uh, which requires a longer engagement time. And of course there are plenty of people who would rather, you know, engaged with, with a creator, um, you know, through written content, um, that has more depth to it, you know, that that takes longer to read and digest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re certainly gonna. You know, probably retain something better and get something more, you know, rich and meaningful out, out of that type of engagement. Um, but, you know, it&#8217;s, but again, WordPress is an open source distributed platform. It&#8217;s not just like Instagram or, or TikTok or Twitter, which has an app that you install on your phone and everyone&#8217;s using the same app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, a word WordPress sites are hosted across the internet in, in a million different places. , you know, and, and there are certainly some big, um, consolidated hosting platforms like wordpress.com, but, [00:36:00] um, you know, you&#8217;re not, it&#8217;s not like every WordPress creator in the world is being merged into this like, you know, central funnel where it&#8217;s just piped into, you know, a single place that everyone&#8217;s engaging with those creators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think it&#8217;s a lot more challenging for, for the WordPress creator in general to find their market. You know, some of them will, can leverage those other platforms, you know, to bring them back to their blog and or, you know, to their site to continue to engage with them. But, um, you know, it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re all collaborating together and, and feeding into an algorithm in, in the creator economy of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it&#8217;s an entirely different beast. Um, you know, I would say that the. WordPress software creators, those that are building plugins through the, you know, wordpress.org, you know, plugin directory. Prob probably have something closer to that than, than the creators who actually created the content. Do you know, just by virtue of using WordPress, of course, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller: Yeah, yeah. The repo is the central [00:37:00] community in a sense, in a way to launch a market, for sure. Okay. Thank you for that. I wanted to, I wanted to segue for a moment cuz I th this is a topic I think we continue to be talking about in the WordPress ecosystem, um, because it&#8217;s how I got started in millions and millions of other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, being able to click publish on your dream, use the software to do something cool and build a business, whether it&#8217;s like you said, the software or the content. Okay. Next topic real quick as we kind of wind down. I want to ask about is what you&#8217;re seeing on WordPress and the enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> Um, again, again, a topic suitable for an entire podcast episode, maybe even a podcast series, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I agree. Well, I mean, look, word, word Press has been, You know, enterprise software now for, you know, I would say at least 10 years, probably a little bit longer than that. Um, you know, to me the real dividing line was when [00:38:00] WordPress b i p spun up, you know, that that was when, uh, I start, started to see the really big sites came on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when we, that&#8217;s when we started to really, you know, work on the really big sites. You know, our, our first, our first enterprise WordPress launches were the Kaiser Family Foundation and New York Post on, on a very early version of, of, you know, WordPress VIP, um, And you know, back then it was, um, you know, there, there were, those were, they were the early adopters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were the ones that saw the, not just the value of WordPress software, but the value of using open source in the enterprise. You know, the having real control over, uh, , um, their software, you know, the, the, the software behind the site was portable. If they decided they didn&#8217;t like their hosting company, they, they could move, they could change anything that they wanted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but the thing that they were starting with WordPress was already pretty good out of the box. So, you know, that was actually pretty minimal. Um, You know, then, you know, a [00:39:00] few years later you had the really, the next big group of, of publishers that we worked with that, um, you know, saw the early adopters were having success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They wanted to be on board. Um, you know, now, uh, I&#8217;m seeing a lot of competition in the market for. You know, from other platforms, um, platforms that are closed source, um, that are, you know, in the long term, more expensive in, in cost of ownership. Um, but you know, the challenge when I&#8217;m talking to, you know, a, a potential client about a project, you know, whether it&#8217;s a nonprofit or a media publisher, it doesn&#8217;t matter. It ends up being a, a similar conversation. Um, you know, I&#8217;m not ever competing against another WordPress agency. I&#8217;m almost always competing against another platform. And, you know, that, and, and it could be something like Arc, bright Spot, um, you know, and even I even see, you know, rebel Mouse every now and then, [00:40:00] um, in, in those sorts of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like the difference between WordPress. Pretty much any other platform is it, you know, not everything is, is included out of the box. Um, you know, with many other platforms you&#8217;re seeing, you know, A A C M S that has analytics included, um, you know, probably more, uh, workflow tools for a large newsroom. Um, especially in, you know, in the case of arc, um, you know, video tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, You know, uh, lots of, lots of other integrations that you know, you, which WordPress is perfectly capable of handling. You know, there are excellent enter enterprise plugins that connect to pretty much any advertising analytics video provider. Um, you know, uh, third, you know, third party authentication provider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take, take your pick of like what enterprise software, you know, you need to integrate with WordPress. Um, there, there&#8217;s probably a plugin for it and. It&#8217;s probably [00:41:00] an enterprise plugin and it probably works really well and gets you, you know, 90% of the way to, to where you need to go. Um, and you know, to me more importantly, You know, you have a choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, you know, if you, if you buy an off, if you, if you sign up with a large, you know, platform that does everything, all in one, um, and you don&#8217;t like their video solution, you&#8217;re stuck. Um, you know, you don&#8217;t have the choice of switching from, you know, Brightcove, the JW player. You know, if, if you think that, that, you know, it meets the needs of your product better, you, you don&#8217;t have that option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the problem, you know, comes into play is, you know, when you get to the point of, you know, negotiating business terms and sending a proposal and talking to people in the, you know, in, in procurement, you know, who&#8217;re trying to compare apples to apples to make the, the best decision for their organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they have, you know, platforms A and B that have all these things built in. Um, you know, this is, this is a [00:42:00] startup cost, this is the monthly fee, and that&#8217;s it. And although WordPress, you know, you&#8217;re getting all the software for free, um, you know, you&#8217;re probably going to hire someone like us to at least help with the initial build and, and, you know, do some integration work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you, you have to pick your hosting provider. Um, so, and then there&#8217;s gonna be an, a monthly cost for that, you know, maybe a startup cost for, for us, and then maybe a monthly cost for us. In the end result, you know, it&#8217;s not gonna take probably any longer to migrate all your content and get set up with WordPress, um, you know, through that method than than signing up for one of these other platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re gonna have a better experience because you know, you have so much more optionality and. Where you host, who you work with and, and what you integrate with. Um, you&#8217;re not paying any licensing fees. You know, you&#8217;re not beholden to a single provider and their business model and their pricing model, um, to run the most critical aspect of your [00:43:00] business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you can control all of that on your own, but that moment when you&#8217;re making the decision. and comparing it for some, for some of the folks that we talked to, I think that it does, it does seem more complex, um, because it sounds like there&#8217;s more work to do. Um, there are more choices to make, um, you know, versus just deciding and picking, you know, one thing versus the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and I think that that&#8217;s a challenge, you know, in, in the, in the enterprise market, which is like, That initial, you know, quote unquote out of the box demo of, of enterprise WordPress, um, you know, isn&#8217;t necessarily as, as well formed as it is for, for some of its competitors. Um, you know, for folks that really understand the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of open source folks that, especially that have used the WordPress before. Um, it, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not a challenge, but, you know, for, for, for organizations that are coming into this really, [00:44:00] um, you know, cold maybe from a proprietary platform trying to make that, that decision, I think it can be, it can be somewhat confusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so the, I mean, I think that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s one of the, the big challenges that I think, you know, enterprise WordPress faces, but, You know, how do you solve it? You know, I think that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the hard part because solving for that would mean, you know, being a bit more, um, being a bit more opinionated about, you know, things that are included in, in WordPress or, you know, for one of the big enterprise hosting platforms to, to pick a direction, um, and, and build bundle more stuff into the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that all of a sudden, you know, immediately, immediately becomes the antithesis of open. Um, so there&#8217;s a middle ground there somewhere. I, I don&#8217;t think that we found it yet. Um, and, and, and also if you read some of the stuff that, like, you know, Tom from Human Made and, and Magda from decode have written, you know, and, and talked about your podcast recently, um, you know, [00:45:00] It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s very much related to, you know, how we are all solving the, the same problems, you know, in different ways across all of our organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, hell, even in the early days of Guten Gutenberg, um, you know, years ago until we standardized, I saw different teams with an alley solving things in different ways. So, um, you know, there. There&#8217;s something to it because, you know, at least for increased collaboration, I think, you know, within our, within our enterprise community, because.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s to all of our benefit, I think that enterprise WordPress continues to succeed and thrive. Um, not just because, you know, I want my company to exist and, and to make money, but, um, if not us, then, then who? Because the, the other options that I see enterprise publishers going to are you. Big closed source platforms and, and that&#8217;s not something that I [00:46:00] believe in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I, I, I don&#8217;t think you should have to pay for software. If you&#8217;re spending money, you should be hiring people to write content, or you should be paying people, you know, to build the really custom aspects of your product that differentiate you, the things that make your business sustainable. The other stuff should be free, you know, and, and open source software is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it, it&#8217;s foundational to what the internet is so, . Um, yeah, I really hope absolutely that we can all get together and find a path forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s one of the reasons I created our, um, enterprise leaders group on post Slack, is I think the conversation needs to be had on multiple levels within the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but I, I&#8217;ve not. Personally been in enterprise work, ever have friends members, uh, that do this, and I go, I love work. What I hear WordPress is doing on that level, you, you know, from all the media organizations you represent. For instance, at Ali, I go, that&#8217;s [00:47:00] cool because when in my daily, I go out and like, what do you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I kind work around WordPress. What&#8217;s WordPress? Okay. But I go, it&#8217;s powering this percentage of the web, or you know, it&#8217;s the dominant thing on the web, uh, for publishing. Um, but also I get to hit those highlights. You&#8217;ve probably been on a WordPress hat and didn&#8217;t necessarily know it. These cool organizations are doing, using this open source tool and continuing to, I think it&#8217;s healthy for the open web to continue to fly the banner of freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, that open source and WordPress in particular, um, champion and to keep that going. I think it&#8217;s healthy for us as a a planet society business ecosystem. It, it seems like it&#8217;s all. Gonna be better when you have these great options, one of which is WordPress. Well, thank you Brad for, um, sharing the story, snippets of your join journey, the things that you&#8217;re doing [00:48:00] with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s all inspiring, and I know it&#8217;ll inspire the members here and those that are looking at click and publish with WordPress or using it in some way, shape, or form. Um, where can we find more about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bradford Campeau-Laurion:</strong> Of course. Yeah. If, if you want to, you know, learn more about Ali, uh, if you want to apply to work at Allie, we are still hiring developers currently and, and occasionally other positions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, just check out ali.com, uh, a l l e y.com.

The team has also begun tracking TTFB (time to first byte) for classic versus block themes in their code health dashboard, which is helping them see the immediate impact of the latest commits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s making visible the performance regression in block theme rendering when compared with classic themes for a simple &#8216;hello world&#8217; page,&#8221; WordPress Performance team contributor Emily Clarke <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/01/31/performance-team-meeting-summary-31-january-2023/\">said</a> in the team&#8217;s most recent meeting. &#8220;As a team, we would like to make sure we’re properly prioritizing the tickets we have for 6.2 that would positively impact this metric—particularly anything that we need to land before the beta 1 milestone next week.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>A few contributors have already been working on improving the server response times for block themes, with PRs that should be landing in 6.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Similar to Gutenberg, WordPress core would gather a set of automated performance metrics along with the existing test runs (e.g. unit tests, coding standards) we already have for each new commit,&#8221; Silverstein said. &#8220;These metrics can be used to identify the exact point a performance regression is introduced into core. At milestones like a major release, the metrics can be compared against the previous release to gauge progress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Silverstein proposes WordPress start small with by simply running a set of automated tests on each core commit for things like load time and total query time for classic and block themes. In the future, the team could capture additional server timing metrics and metrics for other contexts beyond the home page, such as the admin and single post post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Response to the proposal so far has been positive, as the only alternative is relying on individuals to manually uncover new performance bottlenecks and report them. Better tools will help pinpoint these issues faster, before they get rolled out to millions of people. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Given how much emphasis peer CMS platforms place on &#8216;advertising&#8217; their performance and benchmarking it against the industry leaders, investing in tools to ensure WordPress continues to perform optimally makes a lot of sense,&#8221; WordPress marketing contributor Dan Soschin said. &#8220;And, given how many sites are powered by WordPress, even minor gains in performance (including those unnoticeable to most people) add a lot of value to web hosts and lowering overall internet traffic burdens/bandwidth.&#8221; </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 03 Feb 2023 02:50:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WPTavern: WordPress Training Team Seeks Feedback with Individual Learner Survey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=141596\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-training-team-seeks-feedback-with-individual-learner-survey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2181:\"<p>In 2020, WordPress began prioritizing education as critical to the project&#8217;s future, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/learn-wordpress-platform-launches-with-free-courses-workshops-and-lesson-plans\">launching Learn.WordPress</a> to support beginners to advanced learners with free educational content.
